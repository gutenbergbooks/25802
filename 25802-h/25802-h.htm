<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>&#8220;HERE COMES THE BRIDE&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The sudden joyous pealing of the organ could
be heard upon the sidewalk before the stately
church. As there was a broad canopy from the
door to the curb, with a carpet laid down and
motor-cars standing in line, it took no seer to
proclaim that a wedding was in progress within.
</p>
<p>Idlers halted to wait for the appearance of
the wedding party, which was about to come
forth. Some of the younger spectators ran up
the steps and peered in at the door, for there
was only a lame, old, purblind sexton on guard,
and he, too, seemed vastly interested in what was
going on inside.
</p>
<p>One glance down the main aisle of the great
edifice revealed a much more elaborate scheme
of decoration than usually appears at a church
wedding. Its main effect was the intertwining
of French and American flags, and as the bridal
party turned from the altar the horizon blue uniform
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
of the soldier-bridegroom was a patch of
vivid color that could not be mistaken.
</p>
<p>The bride in her white gown and veil and
wreath made, it may be, even a more prominent
picture than did her husband. But that was
only to be expected perhaps, for a girl on her
wedding day, and in the church, is usually the
focus of all eyes.
</p>
<p>It must be confessed (even her dearest friends
must confess it) there was another reason why
she who, only a moment before had been Jennie
Stone, quite filled the public eye.
</p>
<p>In the first place, Jennie was a well-built girl,
and upon her well-built frame there had always
been since her childhood days a superabundance
of flesh. And getting married had not changed
sweet, jolly, funny Jennie Stone in the least! Instead
of coming back down the aisle of the church
with modestly downcast eyes (which is usually a
hypocritical display of emotion), Jennie smiled
at her friends and beamed proudly upon the figure
in horizon blue at her side.
</p>
<p>And she might well be proud of Major Henri
Marchand, for he was in the very best sense a
soldier and a gentleman, and there gleamed a bit
of color on his breast that had been pinned there
by Marshal Foch&#8217;s own hand. As he was still
in active service and had only been given leave
to come to America for his bride, this might be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
considered the last military wedding that the old
church was likely to see&mdash;perhaps for many years.
</p>
<p>The groom&#8217;s French uniform, and even the
olive gray of the best man and two or three other
men in the party at the altar, had lent their touch
of color to the picture. But it was the bride&#8217;s attendants,
however, that made the party so well
worth looking at&mdash;especially to the greater number
of young women and girls in the pews.
</p>
<p>Jennie Stone was a popular girl, and had
friends galore. Many of those girl friends had
come from a distance to see their beloved &#8220;Heavy
Stone&#8221; (as she had been nicknamed in the old
Briarwood Hall days) married to the man she
had met in France while she was engaged in
those useful and helpful occupations into which
so many American girls entered during the war.
</p>
<p>Besides, Jennie was the first of the old Briarwood
Hall set to be married, and this was bound
to be a gala occasion. This was no &#8220;weepy&#8221;
wedding, but a time of joy. And the bridal party
coming down the aisle made as brilliant a picture
as had ever been seen in the old church.
</p>
<p>The maid of honor in pink was as refreshing
to look upon as a bouquet of arbutus. She had
always been a pretty, winsome girl. Now she
was developing into a handsome young woman,
as all Ruth Fielding&#8217;s friends declared. In her
present filmy costume with its flowery picture hat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
the girl of the Red Mill had never looked better.
</p>
<p>The young man at her side in the uniform of
an American captain with his black curls and
dark face, made a splendid foil for Ruth&#8217;s beauty.
Behind him walked his twin sister&mdash;as like Tom
Cameron as another pea in a pod&mdash;and Ann
Hicks, both in rose-color, completing a color
scheme worthy of the taste of whoever had originated
it. For the sheer beauty of the picture, this
wedding would long be remembered.
</p>
<p>In the very last pew, on the aisle, sat an eager
old colored woman&mdash;one of those typical
&#8220;mammies&#8221; now so seldom seen&mdash;in an old-fashioned
bonnet and shawl. She was of a bulbous
figure, and her dark face shone with perspiration
and delight as she stared at the coming bride
and groom.
</p>
<p>Jennie saw Mammy Rose (the old woman had
been a dependent of the Stone family for years),
and had the occasion been much more serious
than Jennie thought it, the plump girl would
surely have smiled at Mammy Rose.
</p>
<p>The old woman bobbed up, making an old-time
genuflection. She thrust out a neat, paper-covered
parcel which she had held carefully in her
capacious lap all through the ceremony.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Janie&mdash;ma blessed baby!&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;I is suttenly glad to see dis here day!
Heaven is a-smilin&#8217; on yo&#8217;. And here is one o&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
ma birfday cakes yo&#8217; liked so mighty well.
Mammy Rose done make it for her chile&mdash;de
las&#8217; she ever will make yo&#8217; now yo&#8217; is goin&#8217; to
foreign paths.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Another girl than Jennie might have been confused,
or even angered, by the interruption of the
procession. But Jennie could be nothing if not
kind. Her own hands were filled with her
bouquet&mdash;it was enormous. She stopped, however,
before the old woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As thoughtful for me as ever, Mammy Rose,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; she said pleasantly. &#8220;And you
know all my little failings. Henri,&#8221; she said to
her husband.
</p>
<p>But the courtly young Frenchman had quite as
great a sense of <i>noblesse oblige</i> as his bride. He
bowed to the black woman as though she was the
highest lady in the land and accepted the parcel,
tied clumsily with baby ribbon by the gnarled
fingers of Mammy Rose.
</p>
<p>They moved on and the smiling, yet tearful, old
woman, sank back into her seat. If there was
anything needed to make this a perfect occasion,
it was this little incident. The bride and groom
came out into the smiling sunshine with sunshine
in their hearts as well as on their faces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew,&#8221; whispered Helen Cameron to Ann
Hicks, who stalked beside her in rather a mannish
way, &#8220;that Heavy Stone could not even be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
married without something ridiculous happening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ridiculous&#8217;?&#8221; repeated the Western girl,
with something like a catch in her throat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it <i>might</i> have been ridiculous,&#8221; admitted
Helen. &#8220;Only, after all, Jennie is real&mdash;and
so is Major Marchand. You couldn&#8217;t feaze
him, not even if a bomb had been dropped in the
church vestibule.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were crowding into the motor-cars then,
and merrily the wedding party sped back to the
big house on Madison Avenue, which had been
garnished for the occasion with the same taste
that marked the color-scheme of the bride&#8217;s attendants.
The canopied steps and walk, the footmen
in line to receive the party, and the banked
flowers in the reception hall were all impressive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; whispered the irrepressible Jennie to
Henri, &#8220;I feel like a prima donna.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are,&#8221; was his prompt and earnest agreement.
</p>
<p>They trooped in at once to the breakfast table.
The spacious room was wreathed with smilax and
other vines&mdash;even to the great chandelier. The
latter was so hidden by the decorations that it
seemed overladen, and Tom Cameron, who had a
quick eye, mentioned it to Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder if those fellows braced that thing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
with wires? Florists sometimes have more sense
of art than common sense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, Tom! <i>Nothing</i> can happen to spoil
this occasion. Isn&#8217;t it wonderful?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Tom Cameron looked at her rather
gloomily. He shook his head slightly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like one of those pictures of the starving
children in Armenia. I&#8217;m standing on the
outside, looking in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It is true that Ruth Fielding flushed, but she
refused to make reply. A moment later, when
Tom realized how the seating of the party had
been arranged, his countenance showed even
deeper gloom.
</p>
<p>As best man Tom was directed to Jennie&#8217;s
right hand. On the other side of Henri, Ruth
was seated, and that placed her across the wide
table from Tom Cameron.
</p>
<p>The smiling maid of honor was well worth
looking at, and Tom Cameron should have been
content to focus his eyes upon her whenever he
raised them from his plate; but for a particular
reason he was not at all pleased.
</p>
<p>This particular reason was the seating of another
figure in military uniform next to Ruth on
her other side. This was a tall, pink-cheeked,
well set-up youth looking as though, like Tom,
he had seen military service, and with an abundance
of light hair above his broad brow. At
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
school Chessleigh Copley had been nicknamed
&#8220;Lasses&#8221; because of that crop of hair.
</p>
<p>He entered into conversation with Ruth at
once, and he found her so interesting (or she
found him so interesting) that Ruth had little
attention to give to her <i>vis-à-vis</i> across the table.
</p>
<p>The latter&#8217;s countenance grew heavier and
heavier, his dark brows drawing together and his
black eyes smouldering.
</p>
<p>If anybody noticed this change in Tom&#8217;s countenance
it was his twin sister, sitting on Ruth&#8217;s
side of the table. And perhaps she understood
her brother&#8217;s mood. Now and then her own eyes
flashed something besides curiosity along the
table on her side at Ruth and Chess Copley, so
evidently lost in each other&#8217;s companionship.
</p>
<p>But it was a gay party. How could it be otherwise
with Jennie at the table? And everybody
was bound to second the gaiety of the bride. The
groom&#8217;s pride in Jennie was so open, yet so very
courteously expressed, that half the girls there
envied Jennie her possession of Henri Marchand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To think,&#8221; drawled Ann Hicks, who had come
East from Silver Ranch, &#8220;that Heavy Stone
should grab off such a prize in the matrimonial
grab-bag. My!&#8221; and she finished with a sigh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When does your turn come, Ann?&#8221; asked
somebody.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe me,&#8221; said the ranch girl, with emphasis,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
&#8220;I have got to see somebody besides cowpunchers
and horse-wranglers before I make such
a fatal move.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have lost all your imagination,&#8221; laughed
Helen, from across the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Maybe I used it all up, back
in those old kid days when I ran away to be &#8216;Nita&#8217;
and played at being &#8216;the abused chee-ild&#8217;. Remember?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>don&#8217;t</i> we!&#8221; cried Helen and some of the
other girls.
</p>
<p>Something dropped on Tom Cameron&#8217;s plate.
He glanced up, then down again at the object
that had fallen. It was a piece of plaster from
the ceiling.
</p>
<p>Chess Copley likewise shot a glance ceilingward.
</p>
<p>There was a wide gap&mdash;and growing wider&mdash;on
his side of the chandelier. A great piece of
the heavy plaster was breaking away from the
ceiling, and it hung threateningly over his own
and Ruth Fielding&#8217;s head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out, Ruth!&#8221; shouted Tom Cameron,
jumping to his feet.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A RIFT IN HIS LUTE</h3>
</div>

<p>Tom Cameron, no matter how desirous he
might be of saving Ruth from hurt, could not
possibly have got around the table in time. With
a snarling, ripping noise the heavy patch of
plaster tore away from the ceiling and fell directly
upon the spot where the chairs of Ruth
and Chess Copley had been placed!
</p>
<p>The screams of the startled girls almost
drowned the noise of the plaster&#8217;s fall, but Ruth
Fielding did not join in the outcry.
</p>
<p>With one movement, it seemed, Copley had
risen and kicked his own chair away, seized Ruth
about her waist as he did so, and so dragged her
out from under the avalanche.
</p>
<p>It was all over in a moment, and the two stood,
clinging to each other involuntarily, while the
dust of the fallen plaster spread around them.
</p>
<p>For a moment Ruth Fielding had been in as
perilous a situation as she had ever experienced,
and her life had been rather full of peril and adventure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
since, as a girl of twelve, and in the first
volume of this series, we met her as &#8220;Ruth
Fielding of the Red Mill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the time just mentioned, the orphaned Ruth
had appeared at her great-uncle&#8217;s mill on the
Lumano River, near Cheslow, in one of the New
England States, and had been taken in by the
miserly old miller rather under protest. But Aunt
Alvirah Boggs, who was Uncle Jabez Potter&#8217;s
housekeeper, had loved the child from the very
beginning. And in truth the old miller loved
Ruth too, only he was slow to admit it.
</p>
<p>Ruth&#8217;s first young friends at the Red Mill were
the Cameron twins, and with Helen she had spent
her schools days and many of her vacations, at
Briarwood Hall, in the North Woods, at the seashore,
in the West, in the South, Down East, and
in other localities, the narrated adventures of
which are to be found in the several volumes of the
Ruth Fielding Series.
</p>
<p>In the book just preceding this present story,
&#8220;Ruth Fielding in the Great Northwest,&#8221; Helen
was likewise with Ruth when she made her famous
moving picture, &#8220;Brighteyes&#8221; in connection
with the Alectrion Film Corporation, the president
of which, Mr. Hammond, had first encouraged
Ruth to turn her entire time and talent
to the writing of moving picture scenarios.
</p>
<p>The fall before the time of this wedding party
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
in which the girl of the Red Mill was taking part,
fortune threw in Ruth&#8217;s way a charming young
woman, a full-blood Osage Indian, in whom Mr.
Hammond saw possibilities of development for
screen acting. At least, to use the trite and bombastic
moving picture phrase, Wonota, the Indian
princess, &#8220;photographed like a million dollars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Great War&#8217;s abrupt conclusion brought
Tom Cameron home just as eager as he had been
for two years past to have Ruth agree to his plans
for the future. As Ruth saw it (no matter what
may have been her secret feeling for Tom) to do
as Tom wished would utterly spoil the career
on which she had now entered so successfully.
</p>
<p>Tom, like most young men in love, considered
that a girl&#8217;s only career should be a husband and
a home. He frankly said that he was prepared,
young as he was, to supply both for Ruth.
</p>
<p>But their youth, in the first place, was an objection
in the very sensible mind of Ruth. It was
true, too, that a second objection was the fact
that she wanted to live her own life and establish
herself in the great career she had got into almost
by chance.
</p>
<p>And then too Tom himself, since his return
from France, had shown little determination to
settle himself at work. Being the son of a
wealthy merchant and possessing, now that he was
of age, a fortune in his own right inherited from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
his mother&#8217;s estate, Tom Cameron, it seemed to
Ruth, was just playing with life.
</p>
<p>Like many another young fellow so recently
from the battlefield, it seemed as if he could not
settle to anything. And his sister encouraged him
in this attitude. Ruth secretly blamed Helen for
this. And therefore her own attitude to Tom had
grown more stern.
</p>
<p>It was now June&mdash;the June following the
armistice&mdash;the loveliest and most accepted time
for a bridal. The ceremony of Jennie Stone&#8217;s
wedding to Major Henri Marchand had passed
off, as we have seen, very smoothly. Even Tom,
as best man, had found the ring at the right moment,
and nobody had stepped on Jennie&#8217;s train.
</p>
<p>But this accident at the breakfast table&mdash;and
an accident that might have resulted fatally for
Ruth Fielding&mdash;threatened to cause not only excitement
but to sober the whole party.
</p>
<p>In a moment, however, in spite of the dust rising
from the broken plaster, the others saw that
Ruth and Chess Copley were both safe. The
latter was repeating, over and over and in much
anxiety:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are all right, Ruth! I&#8217;ve got you. You
are all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl herself was quite breathless. Copley
held her in rather a close embrace, and for a
much longer time than appeared necessary&mdash;to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
Tom Cameron at least. Tom had got around
the table just too late to be of any assistance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We see you&#8217;ve got her, &#8217;Lasses,&#8221; Tom observed,
rather tartly. &#8220;The close-up is shot.
Break away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His words started the laughter&mdash;and there
was much relief expressed in the laughter in
which all about the table joined. People are apt
to laugh when serious danger is over. But it
might have been observed by his friends at
another time that Tom Cameron was not usually
tart or unkind of speech.
</p>
<p>Ruth said nothing, and Chess Copley flushed
hotly. Jennie had got up with Henri in the moment
of excitement, and now she quickly seized
her goblet of grape-juice in which the party had
previously toasted the bride and groom, and
raised the glass on high.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear! Hear!&#8221; cried Ann Hicks. &#8220;The
bride speaks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a good omen,&#8221; declared Jennie clinging
to Henri&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Our Ruth was wounded in
France and has been in danger on many occasions,
as we all know. Never has she more
gracefully escaped disaster, nor been aided by a
more chivalrous cavalier. Drink! Drink to Ruth
Fielding and to Chessleigh Copley! They are
two very lucky people, for that ceiling might have
cracked their crowns.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>They drank the toast&mdash;most of them with much
laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some orator, Jennie,&#8221; commented Helen.
&#8220;We are just beginning to appreciate you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will all be sorry that you did not treat
me better&mdash;especially as a chee-ild,&#8221; returned
the plump bride, with mock solemnity. &#8220;Think!
Think how you all used to abuse my&mdash;my appetite
at Briarwood Hall. It is only Mammy
Rose who is kind to me,&#8221; and she pointed to the
old colored woman&#8217;s gift that had a place of
honor before her own plate and that of Major
Marchand&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me give a toast,&#8221; cried Helen gaily. &#8220;Let
us drink to Jennie&#8217;s appetite&mdash;long may it wave.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness me! Don&#8217;t speak of waves and appetite
in the same breath, I beg. Remember we
are going directly aboard ship from the house and&mdash;and
I never was a good sailor. Waves!
Ugh!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fun went on while the serving people swept
up the debris and removed those dishes that had
been covered with dust.
</p>
<p>Aside, Ruth, taking for the moment little part
in the chatter and merriment, for she had received
a considerable shock, stood talking with Copley.
Ruth had given him her hand again and Chess
clung to it rather more warmly&mdash;so the watchful
Tom thought&mdash;than was needful. But the girl felt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
that she really had a great deal to thank Copley
for.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jennie in her fun spoke quite truly,&#8221; Ruth
said in a low voice. &#8220;You are a friend in need.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I hope you consider me a friend indeed,
Ruth,&#8221; rejoined the young fellow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do,&#8221; agreed the girl of the Red
Mill with her customary frank smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I am afraid,&#8221; Chess added, &#8220;that I am not
considered in that light by all your friends, Ruth.
Helen Cameron hasn&#8217;t spoken to me to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No? Is it serious?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is serious when a fellow gets turned down&mdash;snubbed&mdash;and
not a word of explanation offered.
And, in the words of the old song, we were &#8216;companions
once, but strangers now&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t mind. Helen usually gets over the
mollygrubs very quickly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chess turned to see the other Cameron twin
eyeing him with no great favor.
</p>
<p>However, the throng of guests who were invited
to the reception began coming in, and for
the next two hours the parlors were crowded with
the many friends of the plump girl, who, as Helen
had said, found this the greatest day of her life,
and there was little time for much individual
chat, though, it seemed to Tom, Chess Copley
kept as close as possible to Ruth&#8217;s side.
</p>
<p>It was after Jennie had gone to put on her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
traveling dress, and the immediate wedding party,
who were to accompany the bridal couple to the
dock to see them embark, were hurrying out of the
room to put on street clothes that Tom, in a low
voice, demanded of Chess:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you trying to do&mdash;put a label on
Ruth? Don&#8217;t forget she belongs to all of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chess Copley had not won his commission in
the war and wore only a sergeant&#8217;s chevrons.
But the war was over and he could tell his captain
just what he thought of him. And he did.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what you are, Tom Cameron?&#8221;
he drawled, smiling a hard little smile. &#8220;You
are a regular dog in the manger, and I&#8217;m frank
to tell you so!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>RICE AND OLD SHOES</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It is the greatest day in a girl&#8217;s life,&#8221; declared
Helen Cameron, sitting on the edge of one of the
twin beds in the room she and Ruth occupied
while they were at the Stone house. She buckled
her fingers around her knee to hold one limb
crossed over the other&mdash;a very mannish and independent
position. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I ever
envied Heavy before in my life. But she has
got something now that we haven&#8217;t, Ruth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cat&#8217;s foot!&#8221; exclaimed Ann Hicks from her
chair. &#8220;Who&#8217;d want a Frenchman for a husband?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth laughed. &#8220;Not to say that Major
Marchand is not a fine fellow, I agree with Ann
that I don&#8217;t want a husband. Not&mdash;right&mdash;now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Very well,&#8221; said Helen complacently.
&#8220;But if you thought you&#8217;d never be able to get
one&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks!&#8221; exclaimed Ann. &#8220;As though our
Ruth couldn&#8217;t have all she wants if she wants
them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I really wish you would not speak plurally of
them, Ann,&#8221; cried Ruth, laughing. &#8220;You will
make me feel like the Queen of the Amazons.
They say she keeps a masculine harem&mdash;like a
bey, or a sultan, or something of that kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be serious,&#8221; rejoined Helen. &#8220;I mean what
I say. Jennie&#8217;s great day has arrived. And she
is the first of all our old bunch that went to Briarwood&mdash;and
surely of those who went to Ardmore
College&mdash;to fetter herself to a man for life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I shall never be fettered, even if I am
married,&#8221; observed Ann. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to see myself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the right man comes riding by, Ann, even
you will change your mind,&#8221; Ruth said softly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I suppose the right man has never
ridden up to the Red Mill and asked for you?&#8221;
demanded Helen, with a glance at her chum that
was rather piercing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he has,&#8221; said Ruth composedly, &#8220;but
I wasn&#8217;t at home. Aunt Alvirah thinks I am almost
never at home. And, girls, as I told you
yesterday, I am going soon on another journey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ruth, I&#8217;ve been thinking of that!&#8221; Helen
rejoined, with a sudden access of interest and excitement.
&#8220;To the Thousand Islands! And at
the loveliest time of all the year up there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is only the truth,&#8221; said one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
other bridesmaids. &#8220;We spent last summer
there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Copleys always go,&#8221; Helen remarked
quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Do you mean it?&#8221; cried Ruth, showing
some surprise. &#8220;Well, indeed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you will see a lot more of &#8217;Lasses Copley,&#8221;
remarked Ann.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be glad if Chess Copley is there when
and where we make this picture, for I think he
is very nice,&#8221; was Ruth&#8217;s composed reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s nice enough,&#8221; agreed Helen, rather
grumblingly however. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got nothing to say
against Chess&mdash;as a general thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t seem to say much for him,&#8221;
put in the Western girl curiously.
</p>
<p>But Helen said nothing further on that topic.
Ruth broke in, answering one of the other girls
who spoke of the forthcoming picture Ruth was
going to make for the Alectrion Corporation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course our famous Wonota is going to be
in the picture. For she is famous already.
&#8216;Brighteyes&#8217; appeared for two successive weeks
in one of the big Broadway picture houses and we
are making a lot of money out of its distribution.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we know Wonota is a find for another
very unmistakable reason,&#8221; she added.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; asked Helen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Other producers have begun to make Wonota
and her father offers. For Chief Totantora has
become interested in the movie business too. Mr.
Hammond used Totantora in a picture he made
in Oklahoma in the spring; one in which Wonota
did not appear. She was off at school at the time.
We are going to make of the princess a cultivated
and cultured young lady before we get
through with her,&#8221; and Ruth laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A Red Indian!&#8221; cried somebody.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That makes no difference,&#8221; said Ruth placidly.
&#8220;She is amenable to white customs, and is really
a very smart girl. And she has a lovely disposition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially,&#8221; put in Helen, who remembered
the occasion clearly, &#8220;when she wanted to shoot
Dakota Joe Fenbrook when he treated her so unkindly
in his Wild West show. But, I wanted
to shoot him myself,&#8221; she added, frankly.
&#8220;Especially after he tried to hurt Ruth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind him,&#8221; said her chum at that.
&#8220;Joe Fenbrook is in the penitentiary now, and he
is not bothering us. But other people are bothering
Mr. Hammond about Wonota.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Helen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, as I said, there are other picture producers
who have seen &#8216;Brighteyes&#8217; and would like
to get the chief and his daughter under contract.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
They have told Totantora that, as the contract
with his daughter was made while she was not of
age, it can be broken. Of course, the Indian agent
agreed to the contract; but after Totantora returned
from Europe, where he had been held a
prisoner in Germany during the war, the guardianship
of Wonota reverted to her father once
more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is rather a complicated matter,&#8221; went on
Ruth, &#8220;and it is giving Mr. Hammond and his
lawyers some trouble. There is a man named
Bilby, who has been a picture producer in a small
way, who seems to have some influence with the
head of the Government Bureau of Indian Affairs.
He seems to have financial backing, too,
and claims to have secured a series of stories in
which Wonota might be featured to advantage.
And he certainly has offered Totantora and the
girl much more money than Mr. Hammond
would be willing to risk in a star who may, after
all, prove merely a flash in the pan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; asked Ann. &#8220;I
thought she was a sure-fire hit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No amateur screen actress&mdash;and that is all
Wonota is as yet&mdash;is ever a &#8216;sure-fire hit&#8217;, as you
call it,&#8221; said the practical Ruth. &#8220;Many a producer
has been badly bitten by tying up a new actor
or actress to a long-time contract. Because a girl
films well and is successful in one part, is not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
an assurance that she can learn to be a really great
actress before the camera.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In &#8216;Brighteyes&#8217; Wonota merely played herself.
I was successful in fitting my story to her
individuality. But she cannot always play the
same part. In this story we are about to do on
the St. Lawrence, she will be called upon to
delineate a character quite different from that of
the heroine of &#8216;Brighteyes.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, Ruth,&#8221; sighed Helen, &#8220;what a business
woman you are getting to be. Your career
has really begun&mdash;and so promisingly. While I
can&#8217;t do a thing but play the fiddle a little, daub
a little at batik, and crochet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And make most delightful fudge!&#8221; cried Jennie
Stone, just then coming into the room in her
traveling dress, fresh from the hands of her maid
and Aunt Kate. &#8220;How do I look, girls?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The bride&#8217;s appearance drove everything else
out of her friends&#8217; minds for the time being. It
was two o&#8217;clock and the automobiles were at the
door. The bridal couple, attended by bridesmaids,
the best man, the ushers, and other close
friends, departed for the dock amid showers of
rice and a bombardment of old shoes which littered
Madison Avenue for half a block and kept
even the policemen on special duty for the occasion,
dodging!
</p>
<p>They all trooped aboard the steamship where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
arrangements had been made to have the passports
of the bride and groom examined.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stone had done everything well, as he
always did. The bridal suite was banked with
flowers. Even the orchestra belonging to the
ship had been engaged specially to play. A
second, though brief, reception was held here.
</p>
<p>The ship&#8217;s siren sent a stuttering blast into
the air that seemed to shake the skyscrapers opposite
the dock. The young folks trooped back
to the pier. Tom did his best to escort Ruth;
but to his amazement and anger Chess Copley
pushed in front of him and Ruth took the sergeant&#8217;s
arm.
</p>
<p>Helen came along and grabbed her brother
with a fierce little pinch. Her eyes sparkled
while his smouldered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we are relegated to the second row,
Tommy-boy,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I do not see what
has got into Ruth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not Ruth. The gall of that &#8217;Lasses!&#8221;
muttered the slangy Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you think he is at fault?&#8221; rejoined his
sister. &#8220;Oh, Tommy-boy! you do not know &#8216;us
girls&#8217;&mdash;no indeed you do not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a gay enough party on the dock that
watched the big ship back out and being turned
in the stream by the fussy tugs. The bride and
groom shouted until they were hoarse, and waved
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
their hands and handkerchiefs as long as they
could be seen from the dock.
</p>
<p>If Helen and Tom Cameron were either, or
both, offended by Ruth, they did not show it to
the general company. As for the girl of the
Red Mill, she enjoyed herself immensely; and
she particularly liked Chess Copley&#8217;s company.
</p>
<p>It was not that she felt any less kindly toward
Tom; but Tom had disappointed her. He
seemed to have changed greatly during this past
winter while she had been so busy with her
moving pictures.
</p>
<p>Instead of settling down with his father in the
offices of the great drygoods house from which
Mr. Cameron&#8217;s fortune had come, Tom, abetted
by Helen, had become almost a social butterfly
in New York.
</p>
<p>But Chess Copley, although no sober-sides,
had thrown himself heart and soul into the real
estate business and had already made a tidy sum
during the six months that had ensued since his
discharge from the army.
</p>
<p>It was true, Chess was looking forward to
taking a vacation at the Thousand Islands with
his family. He told Ruth so with enthusiasm,
and hoped to see her again at that resort. But
Chess, Ruth felt, had earned his vacation, while
Tom remained a mere idler.
</p>
<p>Chess accompanied the Cheslow young people
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
to the Grand Central Terminal when they left
the dock and there bade Ruth good-bye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall see you in a fortnight at the Thousand
Islands,&#8221; he assured her, and shook hands again.
&#8220;I shall look forward to it, believe me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom hung about, gloomy enough, even after
they boarded the train. But the girls were gay
and chattering when they entered their compartment.
Ann Hicks was going home with Helen
for a brief visit, although she would be unable
to go elsewhere with them during the early part
of the summer, owing to previous engagements.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am determined to go to the St. Lawrence
with you, Ruth,&#8221; declared Helen. &#8220;And I know
Tommy-boy is aching to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; said Ruth rather gravely, &#8220;that
he might really take to business this summer.
Doesn&#8217;t your father need him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty of time for work, Tommy thinks,&#8221; rejoined
Tom&#8217;s sister gaily.
</p>
<p>But Ruth did not smile.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>BILBY</h3>
</div>

<p>The old, shingled Red Mill, which Jabez
Potter had revamped each spring with mineral
paint, was as brilliant a landmark on the bank of
the Lumano River as ever it had been. In fact,
it seemed as though Ben, the hired man, had got
the red of the shingles and the trim a little redder
and the blinds a little greener this last spring than
ever they had been before.
</p>
<p>Overshadowed by great elms, with the yard
grass growing thick and lush right up to the bark
of the trees, the surroundings of the mill and
farmhouse connected with it (at least, all of those
surroundings that could be seen from the Cheslow
road), were attractive indeed.
</p>
<p>Although the old house seemed quite as it
always had been from without, many changes had
been made inside since first Ruth Fielding had
stepped out of Dr. Davison&#8217;s chaise to approach
her great-uncle&#8217;s habitation.
</p>
<p>At that time Ruth had been less than a mote
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
in the eye of Uncle Jabez. She was merely an
annoyance to the miller at that time. Since
then, however, she had many and many a time
proved a blessing to him. Nor did Jabez Potter
refuse to acknowledge this&mdash;on occasion.
</p>
<p>When Ruth began to do over the interior of
the old house, however, Uncle Jabez protested.
The house and mill had been built a hundred and
fifty years before&mdash;if not longer ago. It was
sacrilege to touch a crooked rafter or a hammered
nail of the entire structure.
</p>
<p>But Ruth insisted that she be allowed to make
her own rooms under the roof more comfortable
and modern. Ruth had seen old New England
farmhouses rebuilt in the most attractive way one
could imagine without disturbing their ancient exterior
appearance. She gathered ideas from
books and magazines, and then went about replanning
the entire inside of the mill farmhouse.
But she began the actual rejuvenation of the
aspect of the structure in her own rooms, and
had had all the work done since her return from
the war zone the year before.
</p>
<p>She now had a bedroom, a sitting room, a
dressing room and bathroom up under the roof,
all in white (Helen said &#8220;like a hospital&#8221;), and
when one opened Ruth&#8217;s outer door and stepped
into her suite it seemed as though one entered
an entirely different house. And if it was a girl
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
who entered&mdash;as Wonota, the Osage princess,
did on a certain June day soon after Jennie Stone&#8217;s
marriage&mdash;she could not suppress a cry of delight.
</p>
<p>Wonota had stayed before at the Red Mill
for a time; but then the workmen had not completed
Ruth&#8217;s new nest. And although Wonota
had been born in a wigwam on the plains and had
spent her childhood in a log cabin with a turf
roof, she could appreciate &#8220;pretty things&#8221; quite
as keenly as any girl of Ruth&#8217;s acquaintance.
</p>
<p>That was why Ruth&mdash;as well as Mr. Hammond
of the Alectrion Film Corporation&mdash;believed
that the Indian girl would in time become
a successful screen actress. Wonota, though her
skin was copper-colored, liked to dress in up-to-date
clothes (and did so) and enjoyed the refinements
of civilization as much as any white girl
of her age.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so pretty here, Miss Ruth,&#8221; she said to
her mentor. &#8220;May I sleep in the other bed off
your sitting room? It is sweet of you. How
foolish of people wanting to see on the screen how
poor Indians live in their ignorance. I would
rather learn to play the part of a very rich New
York lady, and have servants and motor-cars and
go to the opera and wear a diamond necklace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth laughed at her, but good-naturedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All girls are the same, I suppose, under the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
skin,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But we each should try to
do the things we can do best. Learn to play the
parts the director assigns you to the very best
of your ability. Doing that will bring you,
quicker than anything else, to the point where
you can wear diamonds and ride in your own
motor-car and go to the opera. What does your
father, Chief Totantora, say to your new ideas,
Wonota?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The chief, my father, says nothing when I
talk like that to him. He is too much of an old-fashioned
Indian, I fear. He is staying at a country
hotel up the road; but he would not sleep
in the room they gave him (and then he rolled up
in his blanket on the floor) until they agreed to
let him take out the sashes from all three windows.
He says that white people have white faces because
they sleep in stale air.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he is more than half right,&#8221; rejoined
Ruth, although she laughed too. &#8220;Some white
folks even in this age are afraid of the outdoor
air as a sleeping tonic, and prefer to drug themselves
with shut-in air in their bedrooms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But one can have pretty things and nice
things, and still remain in health,&#8221; sighed Wonota.
</p>
<p>Ruth agreed with this. The girl of the Red
Mill tried, too, in every way to encourage the
Indian maiden to learn and profit by the better
things to be gained by association with the whites.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>There were several days to wait before Mr.
Hammond was ready to send Mr. Hooley, the director,
and the company selected for the making
of Ruth&#8217;s new picture to the Thousand Islands.
Meanwhile Ruth herself had many preparations
to make and she could not be all the time with
her visitor.
</p>
<p>As in that past time when she had visited the
Red Mill, Wonota was usually content to sit with
Aunt Alvirah and make beadwork while the old
woman knitted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a contented creeter, my pretty,&#8221; the old
woman said to Ruth. &#8220;Red or white, I never see
such a quiet puss. And she jumps and runs to
wait on me like you do.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my back! and oh, my bones!&#8221; exclaimed
Aunt Alvirah, rising cautiously with the aid of a
cane she now depended upon. &#8220;My rheumatism
don&#8217;t seem any better, and I have had it long
enough, seems to me, for it to get better,&#8221; she
added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor dear!&#8221; said Ruth. &#8220;Don&#8217;t the new
medicine do any good?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lawsy me, child! I&#8217;ve drenched myself with
doctor&#8217;s stuff till I&#8217;m ashamed to look a medicine
bottle in the face. My worn out old carcass can&#8217;t
be helped much by any drugs at all. I guess, as
my poor old mother used to say, the only sure
cure for rheumatics is graveyard mould.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Aunt Alvirah!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say it complainingly,&#8221; declared the little
old woman, smiling quite cheerfully. &#8220;But
I tell Jabez Potter he might as well make up his
mind to seeing my corner of his hearth empty
one of these days. And he&#8217;ll miss me, too, cantankerous
as he is sometimes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Uncle Jabez was seldom &#8220;cantankerous&#8221;
nowadays when Ruth was at home. To the miller&#8217;s
mind his great-niece had proved herself to
be of the true Potter blood, although her name
was Fielding.
</p>
<p>Ruth was a money-maker. He had to wink
pretty hard over the fact that she was likewise a
money spender! But one girl&mdash;and a young one
at that&mdash;could scarcely be expected (and so the
old miller admitted) to combine all the virtues
which were worth while in human development.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep a-making of it, Niece Ruth,&#8221; Uncle
Jabez advised earnestly. &#8220;You never can tell
when you are going to want more or when your
ability to make money is going to stop. I&#8217;d sell
the Red Mill or give up and never grind another
grist for nobody, if I didn&#8217;t feel that perhaps
by next year I should have to stop, anyway&mdash;and
another year won&#8217;t much matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You get so little pleasure out of life, Uncle
Jabez,&#8221; Ruth once said in answer to this statement
of the old man.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! Don&#8217;t you believe it. I don&#8217;t know
no better fun than watching the corn in the hopper
or the stuns go round and round while the meal
flour runs out of the spout below, warm and nice-smellin&#8217;.
The millin&#8217; business is just as pretty a
business as there is in the world&mdash;when once you
git used to the dust. No doubt of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see, Uncle Jabez, that you find it so,&#8221;
said Ruth, but rather doubtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it is,&#8221; said the old man stoutly.
&#8220;You get fun out of running about the country
and looking at things and seeing how other folks
live and work. And that&#8217;s all right for you.
<i>You</i> make money out of it. But what would I
get out of gadding about?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A broader outlook on life, Uncle Jabez.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want no broader outlook. I don&#8217;t
need nothing of the kind. Nor does Alviry
Boggs, though she&#8217;s got to talking a dreadful lot
lately about wanting to ride around in an automobile.
At her age, too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You should own a car, Uncle Jabez,&#8221; urged
Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, stop that! Stop that, Niece Ruth! I
won&#8217;t hear to no such foolishness. You show
me how I can make money riding up and down
the Lumano in a pesky motor-car, and maybe I&#8217;ll
do like Alviry wants me to, and buy one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
contraptions.&#8221; &#8220;Hullo, now!&#8221; added the miller
suddenly. &#8220;Who might this be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth turned to see one of the very motor-cars
that Uncle Jabez so scorned (or pretended to)
stopping before the wide door of the mill itself.
</p>
<p>But as it was the man driving the roadster,
rather than the car itself, Uncle Jabez had spoken
of, Ruth gave her attention to him. He was a
ruddy, tubby little man in a pin-check black and
white suit, faced with silk on lapels and pockets&mdash;it
really gave him a sort of minstrel-like appearance
as though he should likewise have had his
face corked&mdash;and he wore in a puffed maroon
scarf a stone that flashed enough for half a dozen
ordinary diamonds&mdash;whether it really was of the
first water or not.
</p>
<p>This man hopped out from back of the wheel
of the roadster and came briskly up the graveled
rise from the road to the door of the mill. He
favored Ruth with a side glance and half smile
that the girl of the Red Mill thought (she had
seen plenty of such men) revealed his character
very clearly. But he spoke to Uncle Jabez.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Pop, is this the place they call the Red
Mill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I calkerlate it is,&#8221; agreed the miller dryly.
&#8220;Leastways, it&#8217;s the only Red Mill I ever heard
tell on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckoned I&#8217;d got to the right dump,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
the visitor cheerfully. &#8220;I understand there&#8217;s an
Injun girl stopping here? Is that so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Uncle Jabez glanced at Ruth and got her permission
to speak before he answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as it&#8217;s any of your business,
Mister; but the Princess Wonota, of the Osage
Nation, is stopping here just now. What might
be your business with her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So she calls herself a &#8216;princess&#8217; does she?&#8221;
returned the man, grinning again at Ruth in an
offensive way. &#8220;Well, I have managed a South
Sea Island chief, a pair of Circassian twins, and
a bunch of Eskimos, in my time. I guess I know
how to act in the presence of Injun royalty. Trot
her out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trot who out?&#8221; asked the miller calmly, but
with eyes that flashed under his penthouse brows.
&#8220;Wonota ain&#8217;t no horse. Did you think she
was?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what she is,&#8221; returned the man
promptly. &#8220;It&#8217;s what she is going to be that interests
me. I&#8217;m Bilby&mdash;Horatio Bilby. Maybe
you&#8217;ve heard of me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; said Ruth rather sharply.
</p>
<p>At once Mr. Bilby&#8217;s round, dented, brown hat
came off and he bowed profoundly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Happy to make your acquaintance, Miss,&#8221; he
said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t made it yet&mdash;near as I can calkerlate,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
gruffly said Uncle Jabez. &#8220;And it&#8217;s
mebbe a question if you get much acquainted with
Wonota. What&#8217;s your business with her, anyway?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you, old gent,&#8221; said Bilby, taking a
number of important looking papers from his
pocket. &#8220;I have come here to get this princess,
as you call her. The Indian Department has
sent me. She is a ward of the Government, as
you perhaps know. It seems she is held under a
false form of contract to a moving picture corporation,
and Wonota&#8217;s friends have applied to
the Bureau of Indian Affairs to look into the
matter and get at the rights of the business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth uttered a cry of amazement; but Uncle
Jabez said calmly enough:
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what have you got to do with it all,
Mister&mdash;if I may be so curious as to ask?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The girl is given into my charge while her affairs
are being looked into,&#8221; said Mr. Horatio
Bilby, with an explanatory flourish which included
both the miller and Ruth in its sweeping gesture.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>TROUBLE IN PROSPECT</h3>
</div>

<p>Ruth Fielding wished that Mr. Hammond
was within reach; but she knew he was already
on his way to the Thousand Islands, for which
she herself expected to start the next day with
Wonota and her father. She had not heard much
about this Bilby; but what she had learned&mdash;together
with what she now saw of him&mdash;impressed
her not at all in his favor.
</p>
<p>In any event she was not willing to accept
either Horatio Bilby or his declaration at face
value. And she was glad to see that the hardheaded
old miller was not much impressed by the
man, either.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about this business, Mister,&#8221;
said Uncle Jabez, with much calmness.
&#8220;But it strikes me that you&#8217;d better see the girl&#8217;s
father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What girl&#8217;s father?&#8221; demanded the visitor,
and now he seemed surprised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonota&#8217;s. Chief Totantora is the name he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
goes by. It strikes me that he ought to have
a deal more to say about the girl than any Government
department.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s nothing but a blanket Injun!&#8221; ejaculated
Bilby, with disgust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe so,&#8221; rejoined Uncle Jabez. &#8220;But his
wearing a blanket (though I never see him with
it on; he wears pants and a shirt when he comes
here) don&#8217;t figger none at all. He still remains
the girl&#8217;s father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you don&#8217;t know, Pop, that these Injuns
are all wards of Uncle Sam.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe so,&#8221; again observed the miller. &#8220;And
I have sometimes thought that Uncle Sam ain&#8217;t
always been any too good to his red relations.
However, that isn&#8217;t to the point. The girl&#8217;s
here. She&#8217;s sort of in my care while she is here.
Unless Chief Totantora shows up and asks to
have her handed over to you, I calkerlate you
won&#8217;t get her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, my man!&#8221; exclaimed Bilby, at once
becoming blusterous, &#8220;you&#8217;ll get into trouble with
the Government if you interfere with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t scare me none,&#8221; was the prompt
reply of Jabez Potter. &#8220;Right now the Government
of the United States don&#8217;t look so important
to me as our local constable. I guess to get possession
of the girl you will have to bring an officer
with you to certify to all this you say you are.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
Until you do, I might as well tell you, first as
last, that you ain&#8217;t got a chance&mdash;not a chance!&mdash;to
even see Wonota.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Bilby grew even redder in the face than
nature seemed to have intended him to be. And
his little greenish-gray eyes sparkled angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get into trouble, old man,&#8221; he threatened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you let that bother you none,&#8221; rejoined
the miller. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had so much trouble in my life
that I&#8217;m sort of used to it, as you might say.
Now, if that is all you got to offer, you might as
well get back into that go-cart of yours and drive
on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Potter turned on his heel and went back
into the mill, beckoning to Ruth to come with
him. She did so&mdash;for a little way at least; but
she soon stopped to peer out and watch the man,
Bilby.
</p>
<p>When they were, as he thought, out of hearing,
he gave vent to several grunts, kicked a pebble
across the road, and scowled ferociously. He
said something about &#8220;these rubes are smarter
than they used to be.&#8221; He seemed convinced
that he could do nothing further in the matter
he had come upon. Not at this time, it was quite
plain.
</p>
<p>He turned and climbed into the roadster. But
he did not drive back toward Cheslow; instead he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
went up the river road, and Ruth Fielding remembered
that Wonota&#8217;s father was stopping at
the country inn which was only three or four miles
up that road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But nothing can happen because of that, of
course,&#8221; the girl thought, as she entered the passage
that led to the farmhouse from the mill.
&#8220;Wonota is perfectly safe here, and surely Totantora
can take care of himself with that little fat
man, or with anybody else!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She entered the kitchen expecting to find the
Indian girl at work with Aunt Alvirah in the old
woman&#8217;s sunny corner of the great room. The
old woman was alone, however.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Wonota?&#8221; Ruth asked.
</p>
<p>Before Aunt Alvirah could reply an automobile
siren echoed outside of the house. Aunt Alvirah
was smiling and waving at somebody and Ruth
hurried to the window to look out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Helen come for you, my pretty, in that
beautiful big car of hers,&#8221; said Aunt Alvirah.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it fine to be rich?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till I make a few more pictures, Aunty,
and we&#8217;ll have a car too. If Uncle Jabez won&#8217;t
buy one, I&#8217;ve made up my mind to get a car
if it&#8217;s only to take you to drive once in a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t hurt Jabez Potter to buy a car,&#8221;
declared the old woman. &#8220;She&#8217;s coming in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
Ruthie. Oh, my back! and oh, my bones!&#8221; she
murmured, as she got up to receive the visitor.
</p>
<p>Helen swept into the house gaily. She always
had a kiss for the little old woman who thought
her, next to Ruth, the finest girl who ever lived.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re always a sight for anyone to look on
with pleasure, Helen Cameron,&#8221; said Aunt Alvirah.
&#8220;And you&#8217;re mighty smart in that long coat
and cap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you put on your coat and bonnet,
Aunty,&#8221; cried Helen, patting her wrinkled cheek.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to take you for a spin. And Ruth,
too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Wonota,&#8221; suggested Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. The princess shall join us,&#8221; Helen
cried merrily. &#8220;Where is she? Tell her to
leave her everlasting beadwork long enough to
ride in the white man&#8217;s motor-car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Ruth, starting for the stairway,
&#8220;Wonota must be up in her own room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; Aunt Alvirah called from her bedroom,
to which she had hobbled for her cloak
and bonnet. &#8220;I was just about to tell you, my
pretty. Wonota has gone out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did she go?&#8221; and Ruth suddenly
turned back, and with surprise if not exactly with
a feeling of alarm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She said she would walk up the road to see
her father. She is quite fond of her father, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
believe,&#8221; added Aunt Alvirah, coming back with
her wrap and bonnet. &#8220;Of course, Indians have
family feelings, if they do seem to hide &#8217;em so
well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry she went out alone,&#8221; murmured
Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! she isn&#8217;t a child. And she&#8217;ll not lose
her way, that&#8217;s sure,&#8221; laughed Helen. &#8220;Anyway,
we&#8217;ll overtake her and give her a ride. Chief
Totantora, too, if he will deign to step into the
white man&#8217;s car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth said no more. But after the visit of
Bilby to the mill she could not help but feel some
little anxiety. She remembered that Dakota Joe,
in whose show Wonota had once worked, had
tried his best to make trouble for her and Mr.
Hammond because of the Osage maiden; and this
Bilby was plainly a much shrewder person than
the Westerner had been.
</p>
<p>She and Helen aided Aunt Alvirah out to the
car. It was a heavy, seven passenger machine;
but Helen could drive it as well as Tom himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Tommy-boy,&#8221; she explained as she
tucked the robe about Aunt Alvirah before following
Ruth into the front seat, &#8220;went to town
to-day with father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope he will really get down to work now,&#8221;
said Ruth softly, as Helen began to manipulate
the levers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; exclaimed Helen carelessly. &#8220;Work
was made for slaves. And Tom had a hard time
over in France. I tell dad he ought not to expect
Tommy-boy to really work for a long, long
time to come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think that is right, Helen?&#8221; admonished
her chum. &#8220;Idleness was never good for
anybody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t as though Tom was poor. He hasn&#8217;t
got to toil and delve in an old office&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know it isn&#8217;t that,&#8221; cried Ruth warmly.
&#8220;But he should make good use of his time. And
your father needs him. He ought to be idle now,
not Tom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandmother Grunt!&#8221; laughed Helen.
&#8220;You&#8217;re twice as old as Aunt Alvirah right now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;After what we have been through&mdash;after
what the world has been through for five years&mdash;we
all ought to be at work,&#8221; said Ruth rather
severely. &#8220;And Tom is no exception.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I never knew you to be hard on Tommy-boy
before!&#8221; pouted Tom&#8217;s sister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I never had occasion to be hard on
him before,&#8221; Ruth answered. &#8220;He is only one
of many. Especially many of those who were
over there in France. They seem to be so unsettled
and&mdash;and so careless for the future.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Regular female Simon Legree, you are,
Ruthie Fielding.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But when Tom first came back he was as
eager as he could be to get to business and to
begin a business career. And lately, it seems
to me, he&#8217;s had an awful slump in his ambition. I
never saw the like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, bother!&#8221; muttered Helen, and started the
car.
</p>
<p>The car shot ahead, and in five minutes they
passed the country inn, but saw nothing of either
Wonota or the Indian chief. In a cove below the
river bank, however, Ruth caught a glimpse of a
small motor-boat with two men in it. And backed
into a wood&#8217;s path near the highway was a small
motor-car.
</p>
<p>Was it the smart roadster Mr. Horatio Bilby
had driven to the Red Mill? Ruth could not
be sure. But she did not enjoy the ride with
Helen and Aunt Alvirah very much for thinking
of the possibility of its being Mr. Bilby&#8217;s car so
close to the inn where Chief Totantora was stopping.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>AN ABDUCTION</h3>
</div>

<p>The ride in Helen&#8217;s car was enjoyable, especially
for Aunt Alvirah. How that old lady
did smile and (as she herself laughingly said)
&#8220;gabble&#8221; her delight! Being shut inside the
house so much, the broader sight of the surrounding
country and the now peacefully flowing Lumano
River was indeed a treat.
</p>
<p>Helen drove up the river and over the Long
Bridge, where she halted the car for a time that
they might look both up and down the stream.
And it was from this point that Ruth again caught
a glimpse of the motor-boat she had before spied
near the roadside inn.
</p>
<p>There was but one man in it now, and the boat
was moored to the root of a big tree that overhung
the little cove. Not that there was anything
astonishing or suspicious in the appearance
of the boat. Merely, it was there and seemed
to have no particular business there. And the
girl of the Red Mill recalled that Mr. Horatio
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
Bilby&#8217;s motor-car was backed into the bushes near
that spot.
</p>
<p>Had Mr. Bilby, who had announced that his
business in this vicinity was to obtain possession
of Wonota, anything to do with the men in the
boat? The thought may have been but an idle
suggestion in Ruth&#8217;s mind.
</p>
<p>Intuition was strong in Ruth Fielding, however.
Somehow, the abandoned car being there near the
inn where Totantora was staying and to which
Wonota had gone to see her father, and the unidentified
motor-boat lurking at the river&#8217;s edge
in the same vicinity, continued to rap an insistent
warning at the door of the girl&#8217;s mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Helen, let&#8217;s go back,&#8221; she said suddenly, as
her chum was about to let in the clutch again.
&#8220;Turn around&mdash;do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; asked Helen wonderingly, yet
seeing something in the expression of Ruth&#8217;s face
that made her more than curious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I feel that everything isn&#8217;t right with Wonota.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonota!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth, in low tones, told her chum her fears&mdash;told
of Bilby&#8217;s call at the mill&mdash;mentioned the
fact that the Indian girl was probably at this
time at the roadside inn and that the rival moving
picture producer was perhaps there likewise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about that!&#8221; gasped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
Helen. &#8220;Is there going to be a real fight for the
possession of Wonota, do you think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And for Totantora too, perhaps. For he
figures importantly in this picture we are about to
make up on the St. Lawrence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; exclaimed Helen Cameron. &#8220;There
is going to be something doing besides picture
making. Why, Ruth! you couldn&#8217;t keep me from
going with you to-morrow. And I know Tommy-boy
will be crazy to be in it, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth made an appealing gesture as Helen began
to back and turn the car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t frighten Aunt Alvirah,&#8221; she whispered.
</p>
<p>Helen was delighted with any prospect for action.
It must be confessed that she did not
think much about disappointment or trouble accruing
to other people in any set of circumstances;
she never had been particularly thoughtful for
others. But she was brave to the point of recklessness,
and she was at once excited regarding the
suggested danger to her chum&#8217;s plans.
</p>
<p>Bilby had already, Ruth understood, offered
more money to Wonota and Totantora for their
services than Mr. Hammond thought it wise to
risk in the venture. And, after all, the temptation
of money was great in the minds of the
Indians. It might be that Bilby could get them
away from Ruth&#8217;s care. And then what would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
the Alectrion Film Corporation do about this
next picture that had been planned?
</p>
<p>Aunt Alvirah made no complaint as to how or
where the car went&mdash;as long as it went somewhere.
She admitted she liked to travel fast.
Having been for so many years crippled by that
enemy, rheumatism, she seemed to find some compensation
in the speed of Helen&#8217;s car.
</p>
<p>The inn was several miles away from the Long
Bridge; but the road was fairly straight, and as
the car went over the ridges they could now and
then catch glimpses of the hotel. On the right
were cornfields, the dark green blades only six
or eight inches high; and scattered over them the
omnipresent scarecrows which, in the spring, add
at least picturesqueness to the New England
landscape.
</p>
<p>Above the purring of the motor Aunt Alvirah
raised her voice to remark to the chums on the
front seat:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see it now&mdash;did it fall down?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did what fall down, Aunty?&#8221; asked Ruth,
who, though troubled as she was by her suspicions,
could not ignore the little old woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That scarecrow I see coming up. I thought
&#8217;twas a gal picking up stones in that field&mdash;the
one this side of the hotel. It had a sunbonnet
on, and it was just as natural! But it&#8217;s gone.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any scarecrow there,&#8221; admitted
Ruth, turning to look.
</p>
<p>At that moment, however, the car she had seen
parked in the bushes wheeled out into the highway
ahead of them. It started on past the hotel.
There was another figure beside that of the tubby
Horatio Bilby on the seat. Ruth recognized
Bilby at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Helen, slowing down involuntarily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the man I spoke of,&#8221; explained Ruth,
&#8220;I&mdash;I wonder who it is that&#8217;s with him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A girl!&#8221; exclaimed Helen. &#8220;Do you suppose
he has got Wonota?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonota&mdash;with a sunbonnet on?&#8221; cried her
chum.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I bet he&#8217;s running away with Wonota!&#8221; cried
Helen, and started to speed up after the other
car.
</p>
<p>Ruth laid a quick hand on her chum&#8217;s arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait! Stop!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;See what a curiously
acting thing that is he has got beside him?
Is&mdash;It can&#8217;t be a girl, Helen!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly isn&#8217;t a boy,&#8221; declared her friend,
with exasperation. &#8220;He&#8217;ll get away from us.
That is a fast car he is driving.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; exclaimed Ruth again, and as Helen
brought her machine to an abrupt stop Aunt Alvirah
was heard saying:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, ain&#8217;t that reediculous? Ain&#8217;t it reediculous?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is ridiculous?&#8221; asked Helen, looking
back with a smile at the little old woman while
Ruth opened the door and leaped out to the side
of the road nearest the river.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, where are your eyes, Helen Cameron?&#8221;
demanded Aunt Alvirah. &#8220;There&#8217;s that scarecrow
now. That feller is a-running away with
it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Helen flashed another look along the road.
The figure beside Bilby on the seat had been set
upright again. Now the girl saw that it was
nothing but a figure. It was no girl at all!
</p>
<p>&#8220;What under the sun, Ruth&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Ruth was not in hearing. She had dashed
into the bushes and to the spot where she had
previously seen the roadster belonging to Horatio
Bilby parked. The bushes were trampled all
about. Here and there were bits of torn cloth
hanging to the thorns. Yonder was a slipper
with rather a high heel. She recognized it as
one belonging to Wonota, the Osage girl, and
picked it up. The Indian maid was really attempting
the fads, as well as the fancies, in apparel
of her white sisters!
</p>
<p>But what had become of the girl herself? She
certainly would not have removed one of her
pumps and thrown it away. Like Aunt Alvirah
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
and Helen, Ruth knew that the figure beside Bilby
in the car was not the missing Indian girl. He
had attempted to use the scarecrow he had stolen
from the cornfield across the road to bewilder anybody
who might pursue him.
</p>
<p>And this very attempt of the rival picture producer
to foul his trail impressed Ruth that something
serious regarding Wonota and her father
was afoot. If the Indian girl had not gone with
Bilby, where had she gone? And where was
Totantora?
</p>
<p>Ruth could not believe that either Wonota or
her father would prove faithless to their contract
with Mr. Hammond&mdash;not intentionally, at
least. She hesitated there in the trampled bushes
for a moment, wondering if she ought not first
to go on to the hotel and make inquiries.
</p>
<p>Then she heard something thrashing in the
bushes not far away. She started, peering all
about, listening. The noise led her to the head
of a gully that sloped down toward the river&#8217;s
edge. It was bush-bestrewn and the way was
rough. Ruth plunged down the slant of it,
and behind the first clump of brush she came upon
a man struggling on the ground.
</p>
<p>His ankles and his wrists were lashed, and when
the girl turned him over she was amazed to see
that he was most cruelly gagged with a piece of
stick and a handkerchief.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Totantora!&#8221; she screamed. &#8220;What is the
matter? Where is Wonota?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His glaring eyes seemed almost popping from
their sockets. His copper-colored face was a
mask of demoniacal rage. His dignity as an Indian
and his feelings as a father had been outraged.
Yet, Ruth was positive that the figure in
the roadster beside Horatio Bilby was not
Wonota, the chief&#8217;s daughter.
</p>
<p>Her strong and nimble fingers had gone to
work almost at once upon the cord that held the
Indians wrists. She loosened them in a few
moments.
</p>
<p>Totantora leaped to his feet, drew a clasp-knife
from the pocket of his trousers, snapped it
open, and slashed through the cords about his
ankles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Wonota? What has happened?&#8221;
Ruth cried.
</p>
<p>The Indian slashed the handkerchief that held
the gag in place, dragged it out, and cast it away.
He made no reply to Ruth&#8217;s question, but lifting
up his head sent a long and quavering cry through
the grove&mdash;a cry that might have been the war-whoop
of his tribe generations before.
</p>
<p>However, Ruth knew it was a signal to his
daughter that he was free and was in pursuit. If
Wonota was where she could hear!
</p>
<p>Speaking not at all to the anxious Ruth, Totantora
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
started down the gully to the riverside.
The girl followed him, running almost as wildly
as did the Indian chief.
</p>
<p>Bounding out into the more open grove at the
edge of the stream, Totantora uttered another
savage yell. Ruth heard, too, the <i>put, put, put</i>, of
a motor-boat. When she reached the water the
boat she had previously observed was some few
yards from the bank. There were two men in
it now, and Ruth saw at first glance that Wonota,
likewise bound and gagged, lay propped up
against the small over-decked part of the launch.
</p>
<p>The Indian chief halted not even to kick off
his moccasins. He ran to the edge of the bank
and, the water being deep, dived on a long slant
into the river. He rose almost instantly to the
surface, and with a long, swift side-stroke followed
after the motor craft, which was now gaining
speed.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>EXPEDIENCY</h3>
</div>

<p>Up in the Big North Woods Ruth Fielding
had seen loons dive and swim (and of all the
feathered tribe, loons are the master divers) and
she had wondered at the birds&#8217; mastery of the
water. But no loon ever seemed more at home
in that element than did the Indian chief.
</p>
<p>Totantora tore through the water after the escaping
motor-boat as though he, too, were propelled
by a motor. And his motor was more
powerful, in a short race at least, than that driving
the launch in which Wonota was held prisoner.
</p>
<p>Before the men who had abducted the Osage
maiden could get their boat out of the little cove,
Totantora reached the stern of it. He rose
breast high in the water and clutched the gunwale
with one hand. One of the men swung at
him with a boathook; but the other picked up his
canvas coat and managed to smother the chief&#8217;s
head and face in it for a minute.
</p>
<p>Totantora flung himself backward and dragged
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
the canvas coat out of the man&#8217;s hand. Indeed,
he came near to dragging the man himself into
the water.
</p>
<p>The coat did not retard the Indian much. He
grabbed it with both hands, spread it abroad, and
then plunged with it under the stern of the motor-boat.
At once the propeller ceased turning and
the boat lost headway. Totantora had fouled
the propeller blades with the canvas jacket, and
the abductors could not get away.
</p>
<p>The Indian lunged for the gunwale of the
boat again. One of the men was now attending
to the mechanism. The other beat at Totantora&#8217;s
hands with the boathook.
</p>
<p>In a flash the chief let go of the rail with one
hand and seized the staff of the implement.
One powerful jerk, and he wrenched the boathook
from the white man&#8217;s grasp. The latter fell
sprawling into the bottom of the boat. With a
display of muscle-power at which Ruth could
not but marvel, Totantora raised himself over the
gunwale of the boat and scrambled into it.
</p>
<p>The second white man turned on him, but the
Indian met him stooping, seized him around the
waist, and tossed him, seemingly with scarcely an
effort, into the water. The other abductor
scrambled forward to get out of his reach. The
chief bent for a minute over his daughter, and
then Ruth saw that the girl was free and that she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
stood up, unhurt. It was all over so quickly that
it left Ruth breathless.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ruth! Miss Ruth!&#8221; cried the Indian
girl. &#8220;I am all right. My father, Chief Totantora,
would not let these bad white men carry me
away a captive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth waved her hand to the younger girl. But
she watched the white man who was swimming
for the shore. She was not afraid of him&mdash;any
more than the Indian chief was fearful of the
other white man perched in the bow of the motor-boat.
</p>
<p>The swimmer reached the bank, caught hold of
an overhanging bush, and dragged himself out of
the river. He was a hang-dog looking sort of
fellow, anyway; and in his saturated condition his
appearance was not improved. He lay panting
for a minute like an expiring fish, and Ruth looked
down at him perhaps more contemptuously than
she realized.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who you looking at?&#8221; he growled at
length.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I am looking at one of Mr. Horatio
Bilby&#8217;s choice assistants,&#8221; Ruth returned scornfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh? What do you know about Bilby?&#8221; demanded
the fellow, evidently much surprised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know nothing very good of him, I am sure,&#8221;
the girl of the Red Mill replied coolly. &#8220;And I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
am quite confident that you are a fit companion for
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fellow sat up and leered at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t such a mighty fine sight just now, I
guess,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But there are worse than me.
I didn&#8217;t know there were any white folks interested
in this business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You make a perfectly proper distinction,&#8221;
Ruth told him. &#8220;Bilby is not a white man&mdash;not
in his business ethics I am sure. I want to warn
you that those Indians have powerful friends and
you would do well to have nothing more to do
with them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I get you,&#8221; growled the fellow. &#8220;But take it
from me; that Injun don&#8217;t need no friends. He
can take care of himself. He&#8217;s as strong as a
bull.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And with a temper you would best not ruffle.
I do not know what Bilby&#8217;s scheme was, or how
he got you into it. But take my advice and keep
out of any further association with Bilby in this
matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to warn me and my partner,&#8221;
said the fellow. &#8220;We got enough right now. Is
he coming ashore?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned to look at the boat, and then leaped
to his feet in some fear. Totantora, by leaning
well over the stern of the boat, had dragged the
torn coat out of the propeller, and now he was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
coolly examining the mechanism with the evident
idea of starting the boat. The Indian seemed
familiar with the driving power of such a craft.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he will bring his daughter ashore,&#8221;
Ruth said composedly. &#8220;If I were you I would
not cross him further.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t going to, Miss,&#8221; said the fellow, now
on his feet. &#8220;I see Jim is keeping as far away
from him as he can. Jim can&#8217;t swim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go aside somewhere. When they reach the
bank I will try to take Totantora and the girl
away with me. Do nothing to cross him, for
the temper of an Indian is not easily quelled. It
just simmers and may break out again at any
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe me,&#8221; said the fellow, starting off
through the bushes, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t aiming to have another
run-in with him. Not with my bare hands.
I hope he don&#8217;t smash the boat, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do all I can to pacify Totantora,&#8221; said
Ruth, and she really was somewhat anxious on
this point, for the grim countenance of the Indian
chief threatened further reprisal.
</p>
<p>He was busy with the engine for a time; but by
and by the regular popping of the exhaust revealed
the fact that everything was all right with
it. The boat described a circle and came back
into the cove and to the place where Ruth stood
on the bank.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>The second white man, who was younger and
looked less like a drowned rat, remained in the
bow, staring back in apprehension at the Indian.
The moment he could do so, this man leaped
ashore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say nothing to him,&#8221; advised Ruth. &#8220;I will
try to take them both away. And, as I have
warned your companion, have nothing more to do
with Bilby or his schemes. These Indians are my
friends, and they have other friends who are
much more powerful than I am, I can assure you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss,&#8221; said the man, politely enough.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to mix in with that redskin. I
guess not!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wonota stepped ashore and Ruth gave her the
shoe she had lost. Her father followed her. He
turned as though to set the boat adrift, but Ruth
laid her hand upon his wet sleeve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let it alone, Totantora. I hope you will be
advised by me. We will go right away from
here. Instead of waiting until to-morrow, let us
leave here to-night and start for the North.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wonota said something to her father in their
own tongue, and he looked at Ruth more peacefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;White lady is always my friend, I know; and
Wonota&#8217;s friend,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;But these bad
men tried to steal Wonota.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me how it happened,&#8221; Ruth put in, hoping
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
to change his trend of thought and determination.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you, my friend,&#8221; said the Indian
girl. &#8220;A little fat man came in a car when Chief
Totantora and I were walking in the road. He
got us to sit down yonder and talk to him. He
is one of those who have tried to get Chief Totantora
and me to go away from you to make pictures.
He offers much money. And while we
talked, those other two men crept up behind us
and they all seized Chief Totantora and me. We
were bound and our mouths closed before we
knew how many, or how few, our enemies were.
Then my father was left in the wood and I was
carried to the boat. I do not know what became
of the little fat man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw him drive away,&#8221; Ruth said. &#8220;It made
me suspicious. I had already seen and talked
with the fat man, whose name is Bilby. Don&#8217;t
forget that name, Wonota.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will remember,&#8221; said the Indian girl, composedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He may make some other attempt to get possession
of you. Some attempt by aid of the
courts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The white man&#8217;s law is very strange,&#8221; muttered
Totantora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we will get ahead of Bilby before he
can do anything else,&#8221; Ruth went on. &#8220;Miss
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
Cameron&#8217;s car is outside in the road. Go to the
hotel and change your clothes, Totantora, and
I will take both you and Wonota back to the
Red Mill. Until we get away for the North
I shall not want you out of my sight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Indian shook himself much as a dog might.
A lighter expression flickered over his dark face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not suffer cold from a wetting,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;It is nothing. I have nothing at the hotel.
We will go now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, then,&#8221; rejoined Ruth, promptly.
&#8220;It is best that we get away before Bilby can
learn that his plan to make Wonota a captive
miscarried. Hurry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She swept them in her earnestness out to the
road where Helen and Aunt Alvirah saw them
with considerable surprise&mdash;particularly because
of the saturated condition of the Indian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare, Ruth!&#8221; cried Helen, &#8220;you do manage
to get into such perfectly lovely rows. What
is the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Ruth postponed all explanation for a later
time. On their way back to the Red Mill she
did explain to Helen, however, that she intended
to take the two Indians to Cheslow and get a
train for Albany that evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will fool Bilby and whoever is aiding him.
We will get away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you go to-night, so do I!&#8221; exclaimed her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
chum. &#8220;You can&#8217;t lose me, Ruth Fielding. I
can see that we are going to have perfectly
scrumptious times before this picture you are going
to make is finished.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we&#8217;ll fool Bilby&mdash;leave him behind,&#8221;
sighed Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The worst of it is, we must leave Tommy-boy
behind,&#8221; said Tom&#8217;s twin. &#8220;Won&#8217;t he be sore
when he hears about it!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>AT CHIPPEWA BAY</h3>
</div>

<p>Helen pronounced that exodus from the Red
Mill &#8220;some hustle;&#8221; and really it was but a brief
time that Ruth allowed for packing, dressing, and
getting to Cheslow for the eight-forty-five train,
bound north. This was a through train with sleeping
cars, and stopped at Cheslow only on special
occasions. Ruth determined that this was one of
those occasions.
</p>
<p>She hustled Ben, the hired man, off to town
ahead, and by the good offices of Mercy Curtis a
compartment and berth were obtained on that
especial train. Mercy kept the wires hot arranging
this for her friend.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Helen rushed home in her car,
packed her trunk and bag, had them loaded into
the front of the car, and drove up the road again
to the Red Mill where she picked up the two
Indians and Ruth. Uncle Jabez and Aunt Alvirah
were sorry enough to see Ruth go; but this
trip promised not to be a long one, for the picture
should be made in five or six weeks.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>The Cameron&#8217;s chauffeur had been instructed by
Helen to &#8220;burn up the road,&#8221; for there was none
too much time before the train was due, and he
did as he was ordered. Indeed, there were ten
minutes to spare when they reached the station
platform, and the girls spent that time chatting
with Mercy Curtis leaning out of her window
of the telegraph office.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So, you are off on your travels again,&#8221; said
the lame girl. &#8220;I wish I was a butterfly of fashion,
too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Butterfly,&#8217;!&#8221; scoffed Helen. &#8220;Ruth, at
least, is no butterfly. She might be called a busy
bee with more truth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah-ha, Miss Helen!&#8221; returned Mercy, shaking
her finger, &#8220;you are the improvident grasshopper&mdash;no less.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Helen giggled. &#8220;Tom says that that old proverb,
&#8216;Go to the ant, thou sluggard;&#8217; should read:
&#8216;Go to the ant and slug her.&#8217; He does not love
work any more than I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Ruth&#8217;s expression of countenance was
one of disapproval, but she made no comment on
Tom. The train thundered toward the station,
slowing down as though resenting being stopped
in its swift career for even a few moments.
</p>
<p>Mr. Curtis, the station master, made a point
himself of seeing that the baggage of the party
was put into the baggage car. The conductor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
and porter helped the girls aboard, and they
found their sections.
</p>
<p>Ruth was determined that Wonota should not
get out of her sight again, and the Indian girl
was to occupy a berth in the stateroom. Totantora
was to have had the berth; but when he saw
it made up and noted the cramped and narrow
quarters offered him, he shook his head decidedly.
He spent the night in the porter&#8217;s little room at
the end of the car, and the porter, when he found
out Totantora was an Indian chief, did not dare
object for fear of being scalped!
</p>
<p>The party reached Hammond the following
afternoon. Here they alighted instead of at
Redwood, the more popular station of those wishing
to reach the Thousand Islands by way of the
electric road to Alexandria Bay. Ruth and her
party were going direct to Chippewa Bay, for
it was upon some of the more northern of the
fourteen hundred or more isles that constitute
the &#8220;Thousand Islands&#8221; that Mr. Hammond had
arranged for the film company&#8217;s activities at this
time.
</p>
<p>A big touring car was waiting for the party,
for one of the telegrams Ruth had caused to be
sent the evening before was to Mr. Hammond,
and they were glad to leave the Pullman and get
into the open air. Totantora, even, desired to
walk to Chippewa Bay, for he was tired of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
white man&#8217;s means of locomotion. Ruth and
Wonota would not hear to this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we have eluded Bilby,&#8221; said the girl
of the Red Mill; &#8220;but I shall not feel that Wonota
is safe, Totantora, unless you are near her
at all times. You must keep watch of your daughter.
She is a valuable possession.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For once Totantora smiled&mdash;although it was
grimly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A squaw did not use to be counted for much
in my nation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But Wonota is not like
the old squaws.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonota is quite an up-to-date young woman,
let me tell you, Mr Totantora,&#8221; Helen told him
briskly.
</p>
<p>The party remained over night at a small hotel
at Chippewa Bay; but in the morning Ruth and
her companions entered a motor launch and were
transported to an island where the film producing
company had been established in several bungalows
which Mr. Hammond had rented for the
time of their stay.
</p>
<p>The water between the small islands was as
calm as a mill pond; but the party caught glimpses
from the launch of the breadth of the St. Lawrence,
its Canadian shore being merely a misty
blue line that morning. The rocky and wooded
islands were extremely beautiful and as romantic
in appearance as the wilderness always is. Now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
and then a privately owned island, improved by
landscape gardening into a modern summer estate,
offered contrast to the wilder isles.
</p>
<p>The girls spent most of the day in getting settled.
No work on the new picture could be done
for a couple of days, and Helen, naturally, looked
for amusement. There were canoes as well as
motor boats, and both the chums were fond of
canoeing. Wonota, of course, was mistress of
the paddle; and with her the two white girls selected
a roomy canoe and set out toward evening
on a journey of exploration among the closer
islands.
</p>
<p>One of the largest islands in the group was in
sight&mdash;Grenadier Island; but that they learned
was beyond the American line. They saw it only
from a distance, keeping close to the New York
shore as they did on this brief voyage. The tall
tamaracks and the other trees crowded some of
the islands until they seemed veritable jungles.
</p>
<p>Some few, however, were bold and precipitous
in the extreme. &#8220;Just the sort of place for
pirate dens and robber caves,&#8221; Helen declared,
shivering gleefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a romantic puss you are,&#8221; laughed
Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, those cracks in the rock yonder look so
dark and dismal. And there <i>might</i> be dark-skinned
men with red bandanas bound around
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
their heads, and knives in their belts, along with
the rest of the scenery, Ruthie,&#8221; complained
Helen.
</p>
<p>Wonota stared at her. &#8220;Do you mean, Miss
Helen, that there are cholos&mdash;are greasers&mdash;in
these woods? My geography book that I study
shows this country to be far, far from Mexico.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my aunt!&#8221; chuckled Helen. &#8220;She thinks
nobody but Mexicans can wear gay handkerchiefs
bound about their noble brows. Wait till you see
sure-enough pirates&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is perfect nonsense, Wonota,&#8221; said Ruth,
warningly. &#8220;Helen is only in fun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the practical Indian maid, &#8220;I understand
English&mdash;and American; only I do not
always grasp the&mdash;er&mdash;humor, do you call it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; applauded Ruth. &#8220;Serves you right,
Helen, for your silly nonsense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Indians&#8217; fun is different,&#8221; explained Wonota,
not wishing to offend the white girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a pair of old sober-sides, that is what
is the matter,&#8221; declared Helen gaily. &#8220;Oh, Ruth!
drive the canoe ashore yonder&mdash;on that rocky
beach. Did you ever see such ferns?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They brought the canoe carefully in to the
shore, landing on a sloping rock which was moss-grown
above the mark of the last flood. Ruth
fastened the tow-rope to the staff of a slender sapling.
Wonota got out to help Helen gather
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
some of the more delicately fronded ferns. Ruth
turned her back upon them and began climbing
what seemed to be a path among the boulders and
trees.
</p>
<p>This was not a very large island, and it was
well out from the American shore, but inside the
line between the States and Canada. Although
the path Ruth followed seemed well defined, she
scarcely thought the island was inhabited.
</p>
<p>As they had paddled past it in the canoe there
had been no sign of man&#8217;s presence. It had been
left in the state of nature, and nothing, it seemed,
had been done to change its appearance from the
time that the first white man had seen it.
</p>
<p>Some rods up the ascent Ruth came to an open
place&mdash;a table of rock that might really have been
a giant&#8217;s dining-table, so flat and perfectly shaped
it was. She could look down upon Helen and
Wonota, and they looked up and called to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out for the pirates!&#8221; shouted Helen,
with laughter.
</p>
<p>Ruth waved her hand, smiling, and, crossing
the rock, parted the brush and stepped out of
sight of her friends. Two steps she took through
the clinging bushes when a most surprising figure
started up before her.
</p>
<p>There was plenty of light, even if the sun had
gone down. She was not uncertain at all as to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
the nature of the figure that confronted her&mdash;that
of a man.
</p>
<p>She saw almost instantly that the old man&#8217;s
brown eyes were more like a child&#8217;s in expression
than like an angry man&#8217;s. He grinned at her, but
the grimace was involuntary or meaningless.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Hush!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth remained both quiet and speechless, looking
into his wrinkled old face calmly. She
thought he must be a beggar from his clothing,
but she could not imagine him a robber, nor even
one of Helen&#8217;s &#8220;pirates.&#8221; As she said nothing
the old man repeated his sibilant warning:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am &#8216;hushing&#8217; just as hard as I can,&#8221; whispered
the girl in return, and smiling a little now.
&#8220;Why must I &#8216;hush&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; he said again, quite as earnestly.
&#8220;You are in danger of your life, young woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not from you, I am sure,&#8221; she returned.
&#8220;You would not try to hurt me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; he repeated, looking back over his
shoulder into the thicker wood. &#8220;They may come
at any moment now. And although I am their
king, they would kill you. You see, kings aren&#8217;t
as powerful now as they used to be before the
war.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I understand,&#8221; agreed Ruth soberly. &#8220;But
who are you king of&mdash;or what?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am King of the Pipes,&#8221; whispered the old
man. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know what that means,&#8221; he
added, scanning her puzzled face. &#8220;No. And
that&#8217;s the secret. You cannot be told.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; murmured Ruth, somewhat amused, yet
pitying his evident mental state.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; he said again. &#8220;You are in danger.
Go away from this place at once, and don&#8217;t come
here again. If my courtiers see you&mdash;Ha! Off
with her head! I shall have to follow the kingly
custom. It is not my fault,&#8221; he added, in the
same low tone, shaking his head mournfully.
&#8220;We kings have to lead our lives, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be a dreadful life, if you have to order
people&#8217;s heads cut off when they have done
you no harm,&#8221; Ruth ventured.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But my people would not believe that you
would do no harm,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I can see
that you are quite harmless. But they have not
the intelligence I possess. You understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite,&#8221; said Ruth. &#8220;And I will go right
away. Thank you for your kindness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is right, young woman. Go away. And
do not return. It is not safe here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t&mdash;can&#8217;t I do anything for you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; warned the old man. &#8220;No, I do not
think you can. I do not care to divide my power
with any consort. And, unless you are of noble
blood I could not make you Queen of the Pipes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
That would never do. Such a mésalliance would
never do. My people would never stand for it&mdash;oh,
never!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I quite understand that,&#8221; said Ruth, having
difficulty to keep from smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now go, young woman,&#8221; the man said pompously.
&#8220;And do not return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will obey you,&#8221; said Ruth soberly. &#8220;If you
are sure I cannot help you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; he warned her again, waving his
hand. &#8220;They are likely to come at any moment.
And then&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl backed through the bushes and
stepped upon the table-like rock. She would have
bade him good-bye, but he hissed after her another
sibilant &#8220;hush!&#8221; and disappeared as mysteriously
as he had come.
</p>
<p>Ruth descended to the canoe and waited until
they were well away from the island before she
said a word to the other girls about the queer
old man.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A FILM MYSTERY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I told you there were pirates there,&#8221; Helen
declared that evening, when she and Ruth were
in the room they shared together. Wonota slept
in a room adjoining and had already retired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that poor old man was a pirate,&#8221;
returned Ruth, smiling a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he tell you he was &#8217;king of the
pirates&#8217;?&#8221; demanded Helen.
</p>
<p>Ruth laughed outright. &#8220;He said he was &#8217;king
of the pipes&#8217;&mdash;whatever that may mean. Poor
old fellow!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it seems he most certainly had been
&#8216;smoking the pipe&#8217;&mdash;or do they call it &#8216;hitting the
pipe&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me to aid you with any information
on slang,&#8221; admonished her friend. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
suppose he is really king of anything except of a
country of his dreams&mdash;poor fellow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; grumbled Helen. &#8220;You never
will boost romance, Ruth Fielding. Maybe there
are pirates on that island.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Or pipes,&#8221; said Ruth calmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind. When the boys come I am going
to shoo them on to that place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What boys?&#8221; demanded Ruth in surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Copleys arrive to-morrow. And their
place is not five miles away from this very spot.
We&#8217;ll get a motor-boat and go down there to-morrow
evening and welcome them. I got a
telegram from Tom when I came back from
canoeing. I forgot to tell you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom!&#8221; exclaimed Ruth, and for perhaps the
first time in her life she seemed undesirous of
hearing about Tom Cameron.
</p>
<p>Helen gave her a somewhat puzzled side glance
as she found the telegram and gave it to her chum,
who read:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Vacation begins to-morrow. Will be with
you next day. Tom.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<p>Helen giggled. &#8220;You can make up your mind
that he knows Chess Copley has started for this
neck of woods. Tom is becoming Mr. Jealous
Jellaby. Did you ever?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry Tom considers it necessary to take
a vacation when he has only just begun work
with your father, Helen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There you go again!&#8221; exclaimed her chum.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you at all, Ruth Fielding.
Tom doesn&#8217;t have to work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be better if he did,&#8221; said Ruth, and
refused to discuss the point further that evening.
</p>
<p>The next day was just as lovely as that first
one. Preparations were under way all over the
island Mr. Hammond had rented for the making
of the picture which Ruth had written. The
continuity was being studied by Mr. Hooley, the
director; and the principals had been furnished
with their detail.
</p>
<p>The ordinary participants in the filming of a
picture&mdash;the &#8220;extras&#8221;&mdash;seldom know much about
the story. They merely appear in certain scenes
and do what they are told. As the scenes are
not made in sequence these actors of the smaller
parts have little idea of the story itself.
</p>
<p>Ruth, under the advice of Mr. Hammond, had
chosen a certain series of incidents relating to
early French-Canadian history, and it began with
an allegory of the bringing of the Christian religion
to the Indians by the first French priests.
This allegory included the landing of the French
upon the shore of a rocky island where they were
met by the wondering Indians, and Mr. Hooley&#8217;s
assistant had chosen the spot for this scene to be
&#8220;shot,&#8221; not far from the place where the company
had its headquarters.
</p>
<p>Ruth paid little attention to the locations until
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
the moment arrived for the camera work. In
fact, after supplying the detailed script she had
little to do with the preparation of the picture
until the scenes were made. She had never made
continuity, as it is called, for that is more or less
of a mechanical process and is sure to interfere
with the creative faculty of the screen writer.
</p>
<p>In the afternoon of this day Helen engaged a
motor-boat, and she and Ruth set out for the
Copley island, which was some miles away,
toward Alexandria Bay. Caretakers and servants
had been at work there for some time, it
was evident, for the lawns were neatly shaved,
the gardens in full growth, and the family were
already comfortably settled in their summer
home.
</p>
<p>Chess Copley must have been on the watch
(could it be possible that he had inside information
about this early visit of Helen and Ruth?)
for he came running down to the dock before
the gardener could reach that point to fasten the
boat&#8217;s line.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I was just wondering if
we would see you girls to-day; and if you hadn&#8217;t
come I should have got out our launch and tried
to find your camp this evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hullo, Chess,&#8221; Helen said coolly as she
stepped ashore, refusing his assistance. &#8220;Where
are the girls?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There they are&mdash;waiting for you on the
porch,&#8221; he said, rather subdued it would seem by
her bruskness.
</p>
<p>Helen started directly for the wide veranda of
the villa-like house that topped the higher part of
the island. There were several acres of grounds
about the Copley house, for the whole island was
cultivated to the water&#8217;s edge. There was nothing
wild left in the appearance of the property,
save a few of the tall forest trees that had been
allowed to stand and some huge boulders almost
covered with climbing vines.
</p>
<p>Ruth gave Chess her hand&mdash;and he squeezed
it warmly. She gave him a frank smile, and
Chess seemed comforted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nell&#8217;s dreadfully tart with a fellow,&#8221; he
grumbled. &#8220;She&#8217;s nothing like she used to be.
But you are kind, Ruth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You should not wear your heart on your
sleeve,&#8221; she told him briskly, as they followed
Helen Cameron toward the veranda.
</p>
<p>The two girls from the moving picture camp
passed a pleasant evening with their New York
friends. The Copley girls always managed to
gather, Helen declared, &#8220;perfectly splendid house
parties;&#8221; and they had brought with them several
companionable girls and young men.
</p>
<p>Music and dancing filled the evening, and it
was ten o&#8217;clock when the two chums from Cheslow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
sought their motor-boat and set out for the
camp on the Chippewa Bay island. Chess
Copley had kept by Ruth&#8217;s side almost all the
evening, and although Helen treated him so cavalierly,
she seemed provoked at her chum for paying
the young man so much attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand what you see in Chess,&#8221;
she said in a vexed tone to the girl of the Red
Mill. &#8220;He&#8217;s nothing much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is pleasant, and you used to like him,&#8221; said
Ruth quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; Helen tossed her head. &#8220;I found
him out. And he&#8217;s not to be compared with
Tommy-boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I quite agree with you&mdash;that is, considering
Tom as a brother,&#8221; observed Ruth, and after that
refused to be led into further discussion regarding
Chess Copley.
</p>
<p>It was not often that Ruth and Helen had a
disagreement. And this was not really of importance.
At least, there was no sign of contention
between them in the morning.
</p>
<p>To tell the truth, there was so much going on,
on this day, that the girls could scarcely have
found time to quarrel. The sun was bright and
the sky cloudless. It was an ideal day for out-of-door
&#8220;shots,&#8221; and the camera men and Mr.
Hooley had the whole company astir betimes.
</p>
<p>The few real Indians, besides Wonota and Totantora,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
in the company, and all those &#8220;extras&#8221;
who were dressed as aborigines, got into their costumes
before breakfast. Soon after eight o&#8217;clock
the company got away in barges, with launches
to tow them through the quiet waterways.
</p>
<p>In a costume play like this that had been
planned, the participants naturally make a very
brilliant spectacle wherever they appear. But
among the islands of Chippewa Bay there were
few spectators at this time save the wild fowl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And they,&#8221; Helen said, &#8220;might be descendants
of the very birds who looked on the actual first
appearance of the white man in this wilderness.
Isn&#8217;t it wonderful?&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Mr. Hooley, megaphone in hand and
stationed with the two cameras on one of the decked-over
barges, had got his company in position
and the action was begun, it was indeed an impressive
picture. Of course, a scene is not made
off-hand&mdash;not even an outdoor pageant like this.
The detail must be done over and over again before
the cranks of the cameras are turned. It
was almost noon before Mr. Hooley dared tell
the camera men to &#8220;shoot the scene.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The flag-decorated barge bearing the Frenchmen
to the rocky shore moved forward into focus
in a stately way, while the Indians gathered in
a spectacular group on the sloping shore&mdash;tier
upon tier of dark faces, wearing nodding feather
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
head-dresses, blankets, deerskin leggings, and
other garments of Indian manufacture&mdash;all
grouped to make a brilliant spectacle.
</p>
<p>Totantora, a commanding figure, and his
daughter as <i>White Fawn</i>, the demure yet dominant
princess of the Hurons, stood forth from the
background of the other Indians in a graceful picture.
Helen was delighted and could not help
shouting to the Osage girl that she was &#8220;great&#8221;&mdash;a
remark which elicited a frown from the director
and an admonition from Ruth.
</p>
<p>Behind the grouped Indians was the greenery
of the primeval forest with which this rocky island
seemed to be covered. The cameras whirred
while the barge containing the actors representing
the Frenchmen pushed close into the shore
and the whites landed.
</p>
<p>A boy carried ashore the great cross, and with
him came a soldier bearing the lilies of France,
the standard of which he sank into the turf. The
detail of costume and armament had been carefully
searched out by Ruth herself, and the properties
were exact. She was sure that this part
of the picture at least could not be criticised but
to be praised.
</p>
<p>It was three o&#8217;clock before the party disembarked
and went back to the camp for a delayed
lunch. The remainder of the afternoon was devoted
to the taking of several &#8220;close-ups&#8221; and an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
interior scene that had been built on the island
rather than in the city studio of the Alectrion Film
Corporation.
</p>
<p>The films taken earlier in the day were developed,
and that evening after dinner Ruth and
Helen joined Mr. Hammond and Mr. Hooley in
the projection room to see a &#8220;run&#8221; of the strip
taken at the island where the Frenchmen landed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know that that island is the one we
landed on ourselves the other evening, Ruth?&#8221;
Helen remarked, as they took their seats and
waited in the darkness for the operator to project
the new film.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean it? I did not notice. The
island where I met that strange old man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The pirate&mdash;yes,&#8221; giggled Helen. &#8220;Only
we went ashore at the far end of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought of it&mdash;or of him,&#8221; admitted
Ruth. &#8220;Poor, crazy old fellow&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The machine began its whirring note and they
fell silent. Upon the silver sheet there took
shape and actuality the moving barge with its banners
and streamers and costumed actors. Then
a flash was given of the Indians gathering on the
wild shore&mdash;wondering, excited, not a little fearful
of the strange appearance of the white men.
The pageant moved forward to its conclusion&mdash;the
landing of the strangers and the setting up
of the banners and the cross.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>But suddenly Ruth shrieked aloud, and Mr.
Hammond shouted to the operator to &#8220;repeat.&#8221;
The dense underbrush had parted behind the upper
tier of Indians and in the aperture thus made
appeared a face and part of the figure of a man&mdash;a
wild face with straggling hair and beard, and
the upper part of his body clad in the rags of a
shirt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What in thunder was that, Hooley?&#8221; cried
Mr. Hammond. &#8220;Somebody butted in. It&#8217;s
spoiled the whole thing. I thought your men
warned everybody off that island?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw that scarecrow before,&#8221; declared
the director, quite as angrily.
</p>
<p>But Ruth squeezed Helen&#8217;s hand hard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The King of the Pipes,&#8221; she whispered.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>A SMELL OF SMOKE</h3>
</div>

<p>The discovery of the face and figure of the old
man whom Ruth had once met and spoken with
on the island thrust out of the undergrowth and
showing through a good part of the length of
film that had been made that first day, caused a
good deal of disturbance. The King of the
Pipes, as he had called himself, was entirely &#8220;out
of the picture.&#8221; His representation on the celluloid
could not be removed. And he had been in
focus for so many feet of the film that it was utterly
impossible to cut it, and thus save the picture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a wretched piece of business,&#8221; Mr. Hammond
said to Ruth, as they came from the projection
room after seeing the reel run off again
and again. &#8220;The entire scene will have to be
made over. And, aside from that irremediable
fault, I consider the work remarkably good. Mr.
Hooley may never again be able to get it so good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth and Helen had told him about the old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
crazy man&mdash;a hermit, perhaps&mdash;and Mr. Hammond
had given instructions that before the retaking
of the scene was tried the island should be
searched for the King of the Pipes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever, or whatever, he is,&#8221; the producer
said, &#8220;he&#8217;s got to be looked after while we are
making this picture. He is likely to burst most
unexpectedly into any of the outdoor scenes, and
on any location, and break up the show. This is
going to cost money, Miss Ruth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, Mr. Hammond. But it never
crossed my mind that it was on that very island
I had my meeting with the man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When Hooley tries to shoot the picture again
we must send somebody up into that island to
watch for the old fellow. He&#8217;d better be under
confinement, anyway, if he&#8217;s crazy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor old thing.&#8221; Ruth sighed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think he means any harm&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s harmed us all right,&#8221; grumbled the president
of the Alectrion Film Corporation. &#8220;I
tell you, a day&#8217;s work like this&mdash;with such salaries
as we pay, and supplies and all&mdash;mounts into real
money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Ruth, &#8220;some of the film can be
saved. All that until the Frenchmen land&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t dare risk it. In a costume story
like this somebody is sure to get his dress, or
armor, or something, different next time from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
what it was to-day. And if we try to save any
part of this piece of film the change will show up
in the finished picture. Every critical spectator will
see the break and will comment upon it. Might
as well make up our minds to take the loss; but
we must be sure that a similar accident does not
occur again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will Mr. Hooley risk taking the scene over
on that island?&#8221; asked Ruth thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? It is a fine location&mdash;couldn&#8217;t be
beat. We&#8217;ve got to shoo that old man out of it,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl had an idea that if she could meet the
queer old man again she might be able to convince
him that some other island would serve
quite as well for his &#8220;kingdom&#8221; as that particular
isle. At any rate, she hated the thought of his
being abused or roughly treated.
</p>
<p>Soon after the fiasco in the projection room,
Tom Cameron arrived by motor-boat from the
town across the bay. Now, Ruth was secretly
very glad to see Tom. She always would be
glad to see his sunny face, no matter how or when.
But she could not approve of his being here at
the Thousand Islands at this particular time.
</p>
<p>Tom had grown up to be one of those young
men who do not know what they want to do
in life, and the reaction from the strain of his
military life had, as was natural, intensified this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
tendency to drift. After the time that he had determined
to be a soldier, then to go West and hunt
Indians and grizzly bears, and then shifted to
the desire to be a pirate or a policeman, Tom
Cameron had really expressed very little taste for
any commercial pursuit.
</p>
<p>He had made his mark in his preparatory school
and college in several lines of athletics. But a boy
in his position would scarcely become a professional
baseball player or pull an oar for a living.
To tell the truth, Tom had never shown much aptitude
for his father&#8217;s business. Dry goods did
not interest him.
</p>
<p>Yet when he had come home after the armistice
Ruth thought he was going to buckle right down
to business with Mr. Cameron&#8217;s firm. There
seemed to be a super-abundant supply of energy
in Tom that had to be worked off. And Ruth
thought it would be worked off properly under the
yoke of business. Besides, Mr. Cameron was
getting no younger, and he ought to have the support
of his only son in business affairs.
</p>
<p>But the last winter, since Ruth and the Cameron
twins had returned from the Northwest, things
had not gone with Tom quite as the girl of the
Red Mill would have chosen.
</p>
<p>Yet she felt that it was not really her business
to interfere. Indeed, she did not purpose to interfere.
If she undertook to advise Tom it would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
please him only too well&mdash;that she knew, of
course.
</p>
<p>For Tom considered Ruth quite as much his
property as Helen&mdash;only in a slightly different
way. And if Ruth showed in any manner that
she considered Tom her property&mdash;well, it would
be all off, to use one of Helen&#8217;s favorite expressions.
</p>
<p>There was no engagement between Ruth and
Tom&mdash;not even a tacitly recognized one. In times
of stress and need Tom had proved himself to be
a very good friend indeed, and Ruth fully appreciated
this. But during this past winter he had
been somewhat spoiled&mdash;or so the girl thought.
</p>
<p>In the first place, Helen was determined to
make a hero of her handsome brother. Captain
Cameron was pushed to the fore by his sister in
every possible way and manner. Helen had many
gay friends in New York&mdash;she had met them
through the Stones, for Helen had often been with
Jennie when Ruth was elsewhere and more
seriously engaged.
</p>
<p>Naturally Tom had been one with his sister
in gay parties, dances, theater groups, supper
crowds, and all the rest. Business had gone by
the board with Tom; and before Ruth realized
it the young returned soldier had lapsed into a
butterfly existence that busy Ruth did not approve.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
Especially, did she believe, was such an
aimless life bad for Tom Cameron.
</p>
<p>She met him in the living room of the bungalow,
however, with her usual warmth; perhaps
&#8220;lack of warmth&#8221; would be the better expression.
For although Ruth was always quietly cordial
with most people, she was never &#8220;hail fellow,
well met&#8221; with anybody, unless it was her own,
dear, old girl friends of Briarwood Hall.
</p>
<p>She resisted, however, making any criticism
upon Tom&#8217;s presence in the moving picture camp.
Everybody in the house&mdash;and there were several
members of the company there besides Mr. Hammond
and the director&mdash;greeted Tom Cameron
cordially. He was a favorite with them all.
</p>
<p>And the minute Totantora heard of Tom&#8217;s arrival,
the Osage chief appeared at the door, standing
with glittering eyes fixed on the ex-captain and
unmoved expression of countenance while he
waited to catch Tom&#8217;s attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless my heart!&#8221; cried the rollicking Tom,
&#8220;here&#8217;s my old buddy! Totantora, how are
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They shook hands, the Indian gravely but with
an expression in his eyes that revealed a more
than ordinary affection for the young white man.
In France and along the Rhine Totantora, the
Osage chief, had become the sworn follower of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
the drygoods merchant&#8217;s son&mdash;a situation to cause
remark, if not wonder.
</p>
<p>Tom had learned a few words of the Osage
tongue and could understand some of Totantora&#8217;s
gutturals. What the chief said seemed at one
point to refer to Ruth, who, quite unconscious,
was talking with Mr. Hammond across the room.
Tom glanced at Ruth&#8217;s back and shook his head
slightly. But he made no audible comment upon
what the Indian said.
</p>
<p>He did not, indeed, see much of Ruth that
night; but in one moment of privacy she said to
Tom:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to make an early morning excursion&mdash;before
Lazybones Helen is roused from her
rosy slumbers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet you!&#8221; was Tom&#8217;s boyish reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Six o&#8217;clock, then, at the dock. If you are
there first rouse out Willie, the boatman, and offer
him a five dollar bill from me to take us
through the islands in the <i>Gem</i>. That&#8217;s his boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find him to-night and make sure,&#8221; said
Tom promptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a faithful servitor,&#8221; laughed Ruth,
and left him before Tom could take any advantage
of her kindness.
</p>
<p>The appointment was kept to the letter and
minute in the morning. Helen was still asleep
when Ruth dressed and stole out of the bungalow.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
Not many of the people on the island, save the
cooks and dining-room employees, were astir. But
Tom and the boatman&mdash;and the <i>Gem</i>&mdash;were at
the dock in readiness.
</p>
<p>Ruth gave Willie his instructions. He was to
make a landing at the far end of the island on
which the picture had been taken the day before.
It was too early for any of Mr. Hooley&#8217;s men to
be over there looking for the old man whose face
had spoiled several hundred feet of good film.
Ruth wished, if possible, to first interview the
strange man.
</p>
<p>She took Tom into her confidence at once about
the King of the Pipes. She did not believe the
man was so crazy that he ought to be shut up in
an asylum. He was merely &#8220;queer.&#8221; And if
they could get him off the island and out of the
way while the picture was being shot, he might
then go back to his hermit life and play at being
king all he wished to.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a lark!&#8221; exclaimed Tom, looking at the
matter a good deal as his twin sister did. &#8220;And
you are constantly falling in with queer characters,
Ruth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might better say they are falling in with
me, for I am sure I do not intentionally hunt them
up,&#8221; complained Ruth. &#8220;And this poor old man
has cost us money enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too bad,&#8221; was Tom&#8217;s comment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Worse than that, perhaps Mr. Hooley will
never again get as fine an allegorical picture as
he did yesterday. They were all in the spirit of
the piece when the shot was made.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They arrived at the sloping stone beach and
landed as Ruth and the girls had before disembarked.
Ruth led Tom up the rough path into
the woods beyond the table-rock. The trees
stood thick, and the bushes were thorny, but they
pushed through to an open space surrounding an
old, gnarled, lightning-riven beech. The top of
this monarch of the ancient forest had been
broken off and the line of its rotted trunk and
branches could be marked amid the undergrowth.
But the staff of it stood at least thirty feet in
height.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a spread of shade it must have given
in its day,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;All these other tall trees
have grown up since the top broke off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; agreed Ruth. &#8220;But where do you
suppose that queer old man has his camp?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They looked all about the island, coming back
at last to the riven beech. But they found no
mark of human occupancy on the island.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I smell wood smoke, just the same,&#8221; Tom
declared, sniffing the air. &#8220;There is a fire somewhere
near.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They saw no smoke, however, nor did they find
any cavity in the rocks that seemed to have been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
occupied by man or used as the rudest kind of
camp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he doesn&#8217;t live on this island after all,&#8221;
said Tom. &#8220;He could get to half a dozen other
islands from here in a light canoe. Or even on
a raft.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He spoke as though he considered this particular
island his kingdom,&#8221; rejoined Ruth. &#8220;This
was the only place he warned me away from&mdash;not
from the islands in general. I don&#8217;t understand
it at all, Tom. And I don&#8217;t want the men to be
unkind to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it looks to me,&#8221; observed her friend,
&#8220;that if we cannot find him, they will be unable
to find him as well. So I wouldn&#8217;t worry, Ruth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the girl went back to the Gem and sailed
again to the headquarters of the moving picture
company not at all satisfied as to the result of
their undertaking.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>BILBY AGAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>The work of picture making that day went
without a hitch. Mr. Hooley sent several men
into the woods above the spot on the shore of
the &#8220;Kingdom of Pipes,&#8221; as Helen insisted upon
calling the island where the prologue of the picture
was made, and they remained on watch there
during the activities of the company below.
</p>
<p>When the film was developed and run off in the
projection room that evening it was pronounced
by all&mdash;even by Mr. Hammond&mdash;as good in detail
as the spoiled reel.
</p>
<p>From that point the work went on briskly, for
the weather remained perfect for picture taking.
Ruth was busy; but she could give some time to
enjoyment, too, especially in the evening; and
that next evening when Chess Copley appeared
in his own motor-boat, the <i>Lauriette</i>, she was glad
to join a moonlight boating party which ventured
as far as Alexandria Bay, where they had supper
and danced at the pavilion, returning to the picture
camp in the early hours of the morning.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>Ruth was Chessleigh&#8217;s particular guest on this
occasion, and Tom and Helen Cameron went in
another launch.
</p>
<p>The moonlight upon the islands and the passages
of silvery water between them was most
beautiful. And Ruth enjoyed herself immensely.
That is, she found the occasion enjoyable until
they got back to the bungalow and had bidden
the Copleys and their party good night. Then
the girl of the Red Mill found her roommate
rather irritable. Helen pouted and was frankly
cross when she spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what you find so interesting in
Chess Copley,&#8221; she observed, brushing her hair
before the glass.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is nice I think,&#8221; replied Ruth placidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you just ignore Tommy-boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not very well refuse Chess when he
invited me into his launch. I did not know you
and Tom were going in the other boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wasn&#8217;t going with Chess. And I
wouldn&#8217;t let Tommy tag after you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t be so foolish, Helen,&#8221;
sighed her chum.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you act this way,&#8221; declared the rather unreasonable
Helen, &#8220;you&#8217;ll spoil our whole visit
at the Thousand Islands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness!&#8221; exclaimed Ruth, for once
showing exasperation, &#8220;you do not talk very sensibly,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
Helen. I have come here to work, not to
play. Please bear that in mind. If you think I
spoil your sport I will not join any other evening
parties.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next evening when the Copley party came
over to get acquainted with some of the moving
picture people and arrange for a big dance on
Saturday night, Ruth was as good as her word,
and remained in Mr. Hammond&#8217;s office, recasting
certain scenes in her story that Mr. Hooley
proposed to make next day.
</p>
<p>Helen was sure Ruth was &#8220;mad&#8221; and kept out
of the way intentionally. She told Tom so. But
she did not choose to relieve Chess Copley&#8217;s
loneliness when she saw him mooning about.
</p>
<p>Whenever Chess tried to speak to Helen in
private she ran away from him. Whether it was
loyalty to her brother, Tom, or some other reason
that made Helen treat Copley so unkindly, the
fact remained that Chess was plainly not in
Helen&#8217;s good books, although she made much of
the two Copley girls.
</p>
<p>The next day Ruth was quite as busy, for the
making of the picture was going ahead rapidly
while the good weather lasted. This story she
had written was more of a pageant than anything
she had yet essayed. The scenes were almost all
&#8220;on location,&#8221; instead of being filmed under a
glass roof.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>Helen and Tom did not seem to understand
that their friend could not go off fishing or sailing
or otherwise junketing whenever they would like to
have her. But picture making and directors, and
especially sunlight, will not wait, and so Ruth
tried to tell them.
</p>
<p>It was Chess Copley, after all, who seemed
to have the better appreciation of Ruth&#8217;s situation
just at this time. Before a week had passed he
was almost always to be found at Ruth&#8217;s beck and
call; for when she could get away from the work
of picture making, Chess turned up as faithfully
as the proverbial bad penny.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not a bad penny, however, Chess,&#8221;
she told him, smiling. &#8220;You are a good scout.
Now you may take me out in your motor-boat.
If it is too late to fish, we can at least have
a run out into the river. How pretty it is to-day!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If everybody treated me as nicely as you do,
Ruth,&#8221; he said, rather soberly, &#8220;my head would
be turned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheer up, Chess,&#8221; she said, laughing. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t say the worst is yet to come. Perhaps the
best will come to you in time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say that only to encourage me I fear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly don&#8217;t say it to discourage you,&#8221; she
confessed. &#8220;Going around like a faded lily isn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
going to help you a mite&mdash;and so I have already
told you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! How&#8217;s a fellow going to register joy
when he feels anything but?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d make a poor screen actor,&#8221; she told
him. &#8220;See Mr. Grand to-day. He has an ulcerated
tooth and is going to the Bay to-night to
have it treated. Yet, as the French voyageur, he
had to make love to Wonota and Miss Keith,
both. Some job!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow makes love as easy as falling off
a log,&#8221; grumbled Chess. &#8220;I never saw such a
fellow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the girls flock to see him in any picture.
If he were my brother&mdash;or husband&mdash;I would
never know when he was really making love or
just registering love. Still actors live in a world
of their own. They are not like other people&mdash;if
they are really good actors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Copley&#8217;s <i>Lauriette</i> shot them half way across
the broad St. Lawrence before sunset, and from
that point they watched the sun sink in the west
and the twilight gather along the Canadian shore
and among the islands on the American side.
</p>
<p>When Chessleigh was about to start the engine
again and head for the camp&mdash;and dinner&mdash;they
suddenly spied a powerful speed boat coming out
from the Canadian side. It cleaved the water like
the blade of a knife, throwing up a silver wave
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
on either side. And as it passed the <i>Lauriette</i>
Ruth and her companion could see several men in
her cockpit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are those fellows again,&#8221; Chess remarked.
&#8220;Wonder what they are up to? That
boat passed our island yesterday evening and the
crowd in her then acted to me as though they
were drunk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think&mdash;&mdash;Why!&#8221; exclaimed Ruth
suddenly breaking off in what she was first going
to say, &#8220;one of those men is a Chinaman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So he is,&#8221; agreed Chessleigh Copley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that little fat man&mdash;see him? Why,
Chess! it looks like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; asked the young fellow, in surprise
at Ruth&#8217;s excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Bilby!&#8221; gasped Ruth. &#8220;That horrid man! I
I hoped we had seen the last of him. And now
he&#8217;s right here where we are working with Wonota.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had said so much that she had to explain
fully about Bilby, while they sat and watched the
speed boat disappear up the river. Ruth was
sure she had made no mistake in her identification
of the rival picture producer who had made
her so much trouble back at the Red Mill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must tell Mr. Hammond at once,&#8221; she concluded.
&#8220;If Bilby is here, he is here for no good
purpose, I can be sure. And if he has a boat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
like that at his command, we must keep double
watch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think he would try to abduct Wonota
again?&#8221; queried Chess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would believe that fellow capable of anything,&#8221;
she returned. &#8220;I mean anything that did
not call for personal courage on his part.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; murmured Chess thoughtfully. &#8220;I
wonder what he was doing with the Chinaman in
his party. You know, sometimes Chinamen are
smuggled across from Canada against the emigration
laws of the States.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He headed the <i>Lauriette</i> for the camp then,
and they arrived there in a rather serious mood.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE DANCE AT ALEXANDRIA BAY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;You might have been mistaken, I suppose,
Miss Ruth?&#8221; suggested Mr. Hammond, the president
of the film corporation, sitting at his desk in
the room of the main bungalow which he used as
an office. &#8220;It was growing dark when that speed
boat passed you and your friend, was it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not out on the river, Mr. Hammond. It was
light enough for us to see the men in that boat
plainly. Just as sure as one of them was a Chinaman,
the short, fat man was Horatio Bilby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem possible that the fellow would
chase away up here after us when he so signally
failed down below. My lawyer tells me that he
had no real authority from the Bureau of Indian
Affairs to secure Wonota&#8217;s services, after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a man who would not need much authority
to attempt any mean thing,&#8221; said the girl
hotly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be true,&#8221; admitted Mr. Hammond.
&#8220;But it seems quite too sensational.&#8221; He smiled,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
adding: &#8220;Quite too much like a movie plot, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say yourself that he has obtained the
production rights to those &#8216;Running Deer&#8217; stories
that have appeared in the <i>Gotham Magazine</i>,&#8221;
said Ruth, with earnestness. &#8220;They are good
stories, Mr. Hammond. I have read them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I believe they are pretty good material
for pictures. That is, if they were handled by a
practical scenario writer like yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too bad you did not get them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Bilby was ahead of us there. Somehow,
he got backing and bought the picture and
dramatic rights to the tales outright. He can
find somebody besides Wonota to play <i>Running
Deer</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He seems to have set his heart on our
Wonota.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He did make Totantora a whacking
good offer. I must admit he did. I could not
begin to see such a price for the girl&#8217;s services.
And on a mere speculation. But I pointed out to
Totantora that, after all, a promise is only a
promise. He and Wonota have already had considerable
hard cash from us,&#8221; and Mr. Hammond
ended with a laugh.
</p>
<p>He was evidently not so much impressed by the
possible danger of Bilby&#8217;s presence in the Thousand
Islands as Ruth could have wished. She determined
herself, however, to be sharply on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
watch for the reappearance of the coarse little
fat man who had so troubled her and the Indians
at the Red Mill.
</p>
<p>She took Totantora into her confidence, after
speaking to Mr. Hammond, although she did not
say a word to Wonota. Despite the natural
stoicism of the Osage maiden, Ruth did not know
but that Wonota might become nervous if she
knew the plotting Bilby was near at hand.
</p>
<p>The chief listened to Ruth&#8217;s warning with a
certain savage anger in his look that warned Ruth
not to push the suggestion of Bilby&#8217;s determination
to obtain possession of Wonota too far. The
chief was not a patient man, and the possible threat
against the safety of his daughter roused in him
the instinct of defence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me watch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That fat man come
here, me chase him away. Yes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do him any harm, Totantora,&#8221; warned
Ruth. &#8220;But tell Mr. Hammond or me if you see
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nobody saw Bilby immediately, however; and
as several days passed Ruth began to wonder if,
after all, she had not been mistaken in her identification
of the fat man in the boat.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the making of the picture went on
steadily; but something else&mdash;and something
Helen Cameron at least considered of moment&mdash;was
planned during this time.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>Many other summer residents of the Thousand
Islands besides the Copleys had now arrived, and
the gaiety of the season was at its height. There
was one very large hotel at Alexandria Bay, and
it was planned to use its ballroom for a &#8220;big war
dance,&#8221; to quote Helen. It was to be a costume
dance, and everybody that appeared on the floor
must be dressed in Indian costume.
</p>
<p>Wonota helped the chums and the actresses
with the Alectrion Film Corporation who attended,
in the getting up of their costumes and the
staining of their faces and arms. The Osage girl
herself wore a beautiful beaded robe, feather-trimmed
and brilliantly dyed. It was her &#8220;coronation
robe&#8221; in the picture she was helping to film.
But Mr. Hammond, who likewise attended the
dance, allowed the girl to wear this finery, which
really was part of the &#8220;props&#8221; of the company.
</p>
<p>Launches were engaged from Chippewa Bay to
take most of those from the camp who attended
the dance, either as participants in the costume
review or as spectators, but Chess Copley arranged
to come for his particular friends in the
<i>Lauriette</i>.
</p>
<p>Helen was tempted to refuse to go in the Copley
launch; but when she saw Jean and Sara Copley
beside their brother, she went aboard with
Ruth and Tom. There actually was no friction
between the two young men, although Tom usually
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
addressed Chess by that opprobrious nickname,
&#8217;Lasses, while Chess retorted by scoffing at all the
ex-captain&#8217;s opinions and advice on any and all
subjects.
</p>
<p>Really, had she not felt that she was partly
the cause of this mild strife, Ruth would have
laughed at the two. They were, after all, but
grown-up boys.
</p>
<p>It was a gay party aboard the <i>Lauriette</i>, nevertheless.
Even Wonota (whom Ruth was keeping
with her) was gay. And she was so pretty in her
beautiful costume that when they arrived at the
hotel the young men at the dance vied in their
attempts to have her for a partner on the floor.
</p>
<p>There was a fine band and the dancing floor
was smooth. Even Mr. Hammond went on to
the floor, having secured a costume, and Mother
Paisley, who acted as chaperon for the moving picture
girls, was as light as anybody on her feet and
the embodiment of grace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Actor folk nowadays,&#8221; the old woman told
Ruth once, &#8220;are not trained as they once were. I
came of circus folk. My people had been circus
performers in the old country for generations before
my father and mother came over here. My
husband was a trapeze performer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And working on the bars makes one supple
and limber beyond any other form of exercise.
Afterward, while still a young girl, I was in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
ballet. At least, when one has had my training,
one brings to the speaking stage a grace and
carriage that can scarcely be secured in any other
way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As for this moving picture business,&#8221; she
sighed, &#8220;I see these poor girls as awkward as
heifers&mdash;and they are really learning very little.
They depend upon the director to tell them how a
lady should enter a room, and how to walk. But
often the director has never seen a real lady enter
a room! Directors of moving pictures are not
masters of deportment as our old dancing masters
were.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth always listened to strictures upon the moving
picture art and gained what she could from
such criticism. And the harshest critics the motion
pictures have are the people who work in them.
But, after all, Ruth had a vision.
</p>
<p>She felt that in spite of all the &#8220;great,&#8221;
&#8220;grand,&#8221; &#8220;magnificent,&#8221; &#8220;enormous&#8221; pictures already
advertised upon the billboards, the public
was still waiting for a really well made and properly
written and acted series of pictures that
claimed neither more sensationalism than they
possessed, nor were hastily and carelessly made.
</p>
<p>Ruth liked to work with Mr. Hammond, and
he had been very kind and considerate of her.
But she felt that, untrammeled, she would be able
to make better pictures than she had made with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
him. She wanted a free hand, and she felt the
insistence of the treasurer&#8217;s office at her elbow.
Money could be lavished upon anything spectacular&mdash;for
instance, like this French-Indian picture
they were making. But much had to be
&#8220;speeded up&#8221; to save money in other phases of
production.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond, like most of the other moving
picture producers, thought only of the audience
coming out of the theater with &#8220;ohs!&#8221; and &#8220;ahs!&#8221;
upon their lips regarding the spectacular features
in the film shown. Ruth wanted to go deeper&mdash;wanted
to make the impression upon the minds
and intelligence of the audiences. She felt that
the pictures could be something bigger than mere
display.
</p>
<p>But this is all aside from the fun they had at
the costume dance. Ruth and Helen both danced
with Mr. Hammond and Mr. Grand and with several
others of the moving picture people, as well
as with their own friends. Chess got the second
dance with Ruth; and then he had the third; and
then got the sixth. He might have gone on all
the evening coming back to her and begging the
favor had Ruth not insisted upon his devoting
himself to some of his sisters&#8217; friends.
</p>
<p>But, at the same time, Ruth was somewhat
piqued because Tom Cameron did not come near
her all the first part of the evening. She could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
not understand what the matter really was with
him&mdash;why he acted in so offish a manner.
</p>
<p>After that sixth dance (and Ruth had danced
them all with one partner or another) she sent
Chess away from her definitely. She went in
search of Tom. The orchestra began playing for
the next dance. Ruth looked keenly about the
brilliant assembly. She knew Tom&#8217;s costume&mdash;it
was distinctive and could not be mistaken. But
she could not mark it at all in the throng.
</p>
<p>Two or three men asked her to dance, but she
pleaded fatigue and continued to walk about the
edge of the ballroom. Finally, in an alcove, sitting
at an empty table, and with no companion,
she spied the recreant Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Tom!&#8221; she cried cheerfully, &#8220;are you
sitting out this dance too? And the music is so
pretty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The music is all right,&#8221; he agreed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to dance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I do not want to dance,&#8221; he answered
sourly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not&mdash;not even with me, Tom?&#8221; she ventured,
smiling rather wistfully at his averted face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;With nobody. I am waiting for Helen and
the rest of you to get enough of this foolishness
and go home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Tom! You&mdash;you are not ill?&#8221; she ventured,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
putting out a hand to touch his shoulder
yet not touching it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, Ruth,&#8221; he said, and now he glanced
up at her. His look was cold. &#8220;Not at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not yourself,&#8221; she said, more composedly.
&#8220;What are you thinking of?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am thinking,&#8221; said Tom, looking away again
and with the same moodiness, &#8220;that I was a fool
to leave the army. That was my job. I should
have stuck to it. I should have used my commission
and father&#8217;s influence to stay in the army.
But it&#8217;s too late now. I guess I had my chance
and didn&#8217;t know enough to use it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He arose abruptly, bowed stiffly, and walked
away. If Tom had actually slapped her, Ruth
could have felt no more hurt.

<h3>THE KINGDOM OF PIPES</h3>
</div>

<p>Ruth Fielding at first felt only hurt; then
she felt angry. She was no longer the timid, sensitive
girl who had faced Jabez Miller when she
first came to the Red Mill with a tremulous smile,
to be sure, but tears standing thick in her eyes.
No, indeed!
</p>
<p>The present Ruth Fielding, a young woman of
purpose and experience, not only could hide her
feelings&mdash;especially if they were hurt ones&mdash;but
possessed a saving sense of humor. And to her
mind, just a moment later, Tom Cameron&#8217;s very
military looking shoulders and stride seemed
rather funny.
</p>
<p>He had hurt her; but then, he had hurt her as
a boy might. It was true, perhaps, Tom was not
grown up. Ruth considered that she was&mdash;very
much so!
</p>
<p>There he was, daring to complain because his
army career had ended so suddenly&mdash;wishing that
he had remained in uniform. And how would his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
father and his sister have felt if he had done so!
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a great, big booby!&#8221; Ruth whispered to
herself. Then her smile came back&mdash;that wistful,
caressing smile&mdash;and she shook her head.
&#8220;But he&#8217;s Tom, and he always will be. Dear me!
isn&#8217;t he ever going to grow up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>So she hid her hurt and accepted the first partner
thereafter who offered; but it was not Chess.
Secretly she knew what the matter with Tom was.
And she was too proud to let the ex-captain see
that she cared. Nevertheless she was sorry that
the party from down the river broke up as they
did when the time to go home came.
</p>
<p>She found herself in the Copley&#8217;s launch again,
with Chess&#8217; sisters and the members of the house
party the Copleys were entertaining at their
island. This dividing of the clans made it possible
for Chess after letting the others out at the
Copley dock, to take Ruth to the moving picture
island alone.
</p>
<p>It was a lovely, soft, moonlight night. The
haze over the islands and the passages between
could not be called a fog, but it was almost as
shrouding as a fog. When Chess ran the launch
outside into the main stream, where the current
was broad and swift, the haze lay upon the rippling
surface like a blanket.
</p>
<p>They were going very swiftly here, for it was
with the current. Suddenly Chess shut off the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
engine. The &#8220;plop&#8221; of the exhaust ceased. They
drifted silently on the bosom of the St. Lawrence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why I am treated so, Ruth,&#8221; Chess
suddenly burst out. &#8220;Do you know, I&#8217;m awfully
unhappy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor boy!&#8221; said Ruth in her warm-hearted
way. &#8220;I think you are over-sensitive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I am sensitive. I shall always be
when I am&mdash;am&mdash;interested in any person and
their treatment of me. It is congenital.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear, dear!&#8221; laughed Ruth. &#8220;They have discovered
that even incipient congenital idiocy can
be cured by the removal of the adenoids. But
I don&#8217;t suppose such an operation will help you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t tease a fellow,&#8221; complained her
friend.
</p>
<p>He reached for the throttle, then hesitated.
Somewhere in the mist ahead was the throb of
another engine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s this?&#8221; muttered Chess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it is Tom&mdash;looking for us,&#8221; said Ruth,
chuckling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The gall of him,&#8221; exclaimed the heated Copley.
Then he made a gesture for silence. A
long, quavering &#8220;co-ee! co-ee!&#8221; came through the
mist and from the south.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From one of the islands,&#8221; said Chess quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What island is that over there?&#8221; demanded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
Ruth, in a whisper. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the one we took the
first picture on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure is,&#8221; agreed the young fellow, but wonderingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Kingdom of Pipes,&#8221; murmured Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Chessleigh.
</p>
<p>Ruth repeated Helen&#8217;s name for the rocky
island on which Ruth had met the queer old man.
&#8220;That call came from the island, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it did. What&#8217;s going on here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; begged Ruth. &#8220;That launch is coming
nearer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As she spoke, a moving object appeared in the
mist. There was no light upon this strange craft.
Chessleigh shuttered his own cockpit lamp instantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good boy,&#8221; acclaimed Ruth. &#8220;There is something
going on here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>They heard the call from the island again.
There was a low reply from the strange launch&mdash;a
whistle. Then the launch pushed on and was
hidden by the mist again from the curious eyes of
Ruth and her companion.
</p>
<p>But they knew it had gone close to the island,
if it had not really touched there. Its engine
was stilled. All they heard for a time was the
lapping of the waves.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know what it means,&#8221; grumbled
Chess.
</p>
<p>Ruth agreed. &#8220;Let&#8217;s wait a while. We may
hear or see something more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t see much, I guess,&#8221; replied her companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind. Let the boat drift. We&#8217;re all
right out here in the current, are we not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess so. It beats my time,&#8221; said her friend.
&#8220;They say there is a lot of smuggling done along
the border.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you say so?&#8221; gasped Ruth, clasping her
hands and almost as excited as Helen might have
been. &#8220;Smugglers! Think of it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And bad eggs they are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course there is no danger?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Danger of what?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t the smugglers hurt us if we caught
them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve got a loaded pistol in the
cabin. Guess I&#8217;ll get it out,&#8221; said Chess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you won&#8217;t!&#8221; Ruth exclaimed. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
go right away from here before we get into a
fight!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; grunted Chess. &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose
they would welcome any spies if they are
smugglers, do you?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what do they smuggle? Diamonds? Precious
stones?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. Maybe. There is a heavy internal
revenue tax on diamonds,&#8221; Chess said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness! wouldn&#8217;t Helen like to be here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d want to go ashore and take a hand
in it,&#8221; grinned Copley. &#8220;I know her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Helen is brave,&#8221; admitted Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! She&#8217;s foolish, you mean,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;Whatever and whoever those fellows
are, they would not welcome visitors I fancy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Their launch had been drifting by the island,
the upper ridge and trees of which they could
see quite plainly. Suddenly a breath of wind&mdash;the
forecast of the breeze that often rises toward
daybreak&mdash;swooped down upon the river. It
split the mist and revealed quite clearly the upper
end of the island where Ruth had interviewed the
queer old man, and which Copley&#8217;s launch had
now drifted past.
</p>
<p>A light showed suddenly, and for a few moments,
close to the water&#8217;s edge. It revealed
enough for the two in the drifting launch to see
several figures outlined in the misty illumination
of the light.
</p>
<p>There was the bow of the mysterious boat close
against the landing place. At least three men
were in the boat and on the shore. Ruth could
not be sure that either of them was the old man
she had spoken with.
</p>
<p>But she and Chess Copley saw that they were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
unloading something from the boat&mdash;square,
seemingly heavy boxes, yet not so heavy that they
could not be passed from hand to hand. One was
about all the weight a man might easily lift.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose those boxes are?&#8221;
whispered Ruth, as the Copley launch drifted into
the mist again and the end of the island and the
other boat were blotted out of sight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it up. Provisions&mdash;supplies. Maybe
they are going to camp there. Lots of people
camp out on these smaller islands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The King of the Pipes will have something
to say about that,&#8221; laughed Ruth. &#8220;One thing
sure about it,&#8221; she added the next moment, as
Chess started his engine again. &#8220;Those boxes
don&#8217;t contain diamonds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So if we saw smugglers they are smuggling
something besides precious stones,&#8221; said the girl
gaily. &#8220;Won&#8217;t Helen be interested when I tell
her!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A DEMAND IS MADE</h3>
</div>

<p>Helen had gone to bed when Ruth went into
their bedroom that morning, and either she was
asleep or did not want to speak to her chum.
Ruth felt that, after what had gone on at the ball
at Alexandria Bay, she had better not wake Helen
up to tell her about the strange launch that had
landed at the Kingdom of the Pipes.
</p>
<p>And in the morning the attitude of both Helen
and Tom closed Ruth&#8217;s lips on all subjects. The
twins were plainly offended. Why? Because
Ruth had shown ordinary interest in other people
besides themselves!
</p>
<p>At least, that is how Ruth saw it. She thought
it very silly for Helen to be jealous. Tom&#8217;s
jealousy was another matter; but he had brought
the situation on himself.
</p>
<p>For once Ruth was determined not to give in,
as she so often did when Helen showed spleen.
Fortunately, Ruth was busy with her picture work,
so she had good reason to excuse herself from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
much association with the Cameron twins during
the next two days.
</p>
<p>Then something happened to give them all an
entirely different topic of thought and conversation.
That day had been spent in taking close-ups
and scenes under the canvas and glass roof
of the make-shift studio that had been built at the
camp. The great pageant of historical times
along the St. Lawrence was moving swiftly on its
way. The scenes of a picture are seldom taken
in any sequence at all, but Mr. Hooley had gone
so far now that the bulk of the scenes had been
filmed; and as they had been run off in the little
projection room, both Mr. Hammond and Ruth
had expressed their approval of almost every
finished length of celluloid.
</p>
<p>The work was practically over for the day at
four o&#8217;clock and the actors in their costumes&mdash;especially
the Indians, including Wonota and her
father&mdash;made a brilliant picture as they wandered
about the lawns and in and out of the several
bungalows on the island.
</p>
<p>From the direction of Chippewa Bay appeared
a chugging motor-launch that came directly to the
dock. It was not one of the hired launches used
by the picture company, nor were those in the
launch men who had anything to do with Mr.
Hammond&#8217;s corporation.
</p>
<p>But when Ruth idly looked into the launch from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
her seat with Helen and Miss Keith and Mrs.
Paisley on the porch of their house, the girl of
the Red Mill got up suddenly, uttering an astonished
exclamation:
</p>
<p>&#8220;That horrid man again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoity-toity!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Paisley.
&#8220;What man deserves such a title as that, Miss
Fielding?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That Bilby!&#8221; exclaimed Ruth. &#8220;I just felt
it in my bones&mdash;like Aunt Alvirah&mdash;that that
creature would annoy us again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are not disappointed,&#8221; said Helen
drily. &#8220;Is that the fellow&mdash;that big gawk in the
blue suit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! I don&#8217;t know him,&#8221; said Ruth. &#8220;The
little fat man tagging after the big fellow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For two men from the launch had now stepped
ashore. In accordance with orders from Mr.
Hammond, the visitors were stopped at the head
of the dock. Nobody was allowed on the island
without invitation or a permit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me tell you,&#8221; said the man in blue pompously,
&#8220;that I am a county officer. You&#8217;d better
have a care, young fellow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say! I don&#8217;t care if you are the King of the
Yaps,&#8221; said Willie, the boatman. &#8220;I have my
orders. This is private property. Stay where
you are&mdash;right where you are, mind!&mdash;till I send
for the boss.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You send for them two Injuns&mdash;that is who
our business is with,&#8221; put in Bilby. &#8220;That Totantora
and Wonota. I want to see them&mdash;not that
Hammond.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth had run to another house to warn those
very individuals to get out of the way and to keep
out of sight until Bilby&#8217;s visit was over. She did
not know, of course, who the big man in blue was.
</p>
<p>The latter was inclined to be pompous and
commanding, even when Mr. Hammond came
down to the head of the dock to see him. It was
evident that Bilby&#8217;s money felt warm in the deputy
sheriff&#8217;s pocket, and he was determined to give
the little fat man full weight for his cash.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This here business is something that can be
settled without any row, Mr. Hammond&mdash;if that&#8217;s
your name,&#8221; said the officer, puffingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my name, all right,&#8221; returned the president
of the Alectrion Corporation. &#8220;And I
don&#8217;t expect any row. What do you want&mdash;and
that fellow behind you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Horatio Bilby grinned rather sheepishly.
&#8220;Well, you know, Mr. Hammond, all&#8217;s fair in
love and war.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is certainly not love,&#8221; said the moving
picture man. &#8220;Now, what do you both want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are ordered to bring two people into
court,&#8221; said the deputy sheriff, &#8220;and show cause
why they shouldn&#8217;t be handed over to Mr. Bilby
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
pending certain proceedings to break their contract
with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Blunt enough,&#8221; admitted Mr. Hammond, but
without excitement. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see: You have a paper
of some kind, I suppose, to serve on me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a summons for you,&#8221; said the officer,
drawing forth some papers, &#8220;and I propose to
take the two Indians back to the Bay with
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can serve me, and I will arrange for my
representative to appear for me in your court,&#8221;
said Hammond. &#8220;But Totantora, to whom I
suppose you refer, is a citizen of the United States,
and you will have to find him to serve him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s nothing but an Injun!&#8221; squealed Bilby,
in wrath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Being an Osage Indian, and owning properly
surveyed oil lands in Oklahoma, the Government
has acknowledged his citizenship,&#8221; was the quiet
reply. &#8220;He certainly is a good American and will
doubtless answer to any court demand&mdash;if you
can serve him legally.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You got him hid away somewhere?&#8221; demanded
the deputy sheriff.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the girl, too!&#8221; cried Bilby. &#8220;I want the
girl more than I do the crazy old Indian.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll think he&#8217;s crazy if he ever sets eyes on
you again, Mr. Bilby,&#8221; was Mr. Hammond&#8217;s
warning. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t forgotten you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>Bilby drew back&mdash;and he looked frightened,
too. &#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t want him right now,&#8221; he muttered.
</p>
<p>Hammond accepted the summons of the local
court, glanced at it, and put it in his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see I have five days&#8217; grace,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;All right. I will see that proper representation
is made before the court.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we want them Indians,&#8221; said the deputy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This island is private property. I have hired
its use for a certain term. I will allow you on it
only under proper legal motion. Have you a
search warrant?&#8221; Hammond asked the deputy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got a warrant. I don&#8217;t need a warrant
for a couple of Indians. They ain&#8217;t got any
standing in this community. I know Indians all
right. You give &#8217;em over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not even acknowledge that the two individuals
you demand are under my control. At
least, I know very well that no United States
court can touch the young woman, Wonota, except
through her guardian. That guardian is her
father. I don&#8217;t see him here&mdash;do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better produce him,&#8221; threatened the
deputy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t make me. Go back and get proper
authority&mdash;if you can,&#8221; advised Mr. Hammond.
&#8220;And don&#8217;t come here again&mdash;either of
you&mdash;without proper authority. Willie!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;On the job,&#8221; said the boatman, grinning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let these fellows upon the island again&mdash;not
even on the dock. Not unless they are
armed with a proper warrant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned his back on the visitors and started
toward the nearest bungalow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be sorry for this, Hammond!&#8221; shouted
Horatio Bilby. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get you yet, and don&#8217;t you
forget it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To get me, as you call it, you will have to
have both right and might on your side, Bilby.
And just now you do not seem to have either,&#8221;
was the Parthian shot the president of the Alectrion
Corporation sent over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>Willie hustled the deputy and the fat man back
into their launch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on away from here,&#8221; advised Willie. &#8220;I
know you, Tom Satchett&mdash;known you all my life.
All you are fit for is to jump a few fishermen
and game hunters that break the law. This job
is too big for you. You&#8217;re up against money and
influence, both, this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t forget you, Willie,&#8221; growled the
deputy. &#8220;You&#8217;ll want something of me some
time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want something of you right now,&#8221; put in the
boatman. &#8220;A good reason for punching you.
Go on into your boat before I find it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>So the pair retreated. But Ruth came to Mr.
Hammond in some little disturbance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;Suppose
they take Wonota away before the picture
is finished?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t. At least, I don&#8217;t believe the
court will allow it. I will telegraph to a good
lawyer and have him come up here and watch proceedings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, if it should happen, we would be in a
bad fix, Mr. Hammond. Mr. Hooley says nobody
could double for Wonota.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not cross bridges until we come to them,&#8221;
returned her friend.
</p>
<p>But perhaps Mr. Hammond felt less confidence
than he managed to get into his voice and
appearance at that moment.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE YELLOW LADY</h3>
</div>

<p>There could be no further haste about the
making of the picture, &#8220;The Long Lane&#8217;s Turning.&#8221;
Although most of the big scenes were already
shot, those that remained to do held in them
the more poignant action of the piece and must be
rehearsed over and over again.
</p>
<p>Much time is sometimes spent upon a single
scene&mdash;a few feet of a reel. Infinite patience,
repetition and experimenting go into the making
of a pictured story. Infinite detail and a close attention
to that detail make the successful picture.
</p>
<p>To stage a &#8220;big&#8221; scene may seem to be a marvelous
feat of the director. But in a big scene,
with a large number of actors, the latter are
divided into groups, each group has its captain,
and each individual actor has to follow the lead
of his particular captain. The groups are trained
and perfected in every little motion before they
come into the real scene before the camera.
</p>
<p>Thus the allegorical picture that was a prologue
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
to &#8220;The Long Lane&#8217;s Turning&#8221; had been gone
over and rehearsed again and again by the principal
actors in it, even before the company left
New York City.
</p>
<p>Now, with all these &#8220;big&#8221; scenes filmed, the
more difficult work of making the individual
scenes of action came to the fore. Wonota had
to be coached over and over again in her scenes
with Mr. Grand and Miss Keith. Both the latter
were well-practised screen actors and could register
the ordinary gamut of emotions as easily as
they ate their breakfast or powdered their noses.
</p>
<p>With Wonota, however, it was different. In
the first place, she came of a tribe of people in
whom it was bred to smother all expression of
emotion&mdash;even the most poignant. Wonota almost
worshiped her father; but did she ever look
upon Chief Totantora with a smile of pride or
with affection beaming in her eyes?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so you&#8217;d notice it,&#8221; said Helen, on one
occasion. &#8220;Ordinarily, as far as her looks go,
Totantora might be a stranger to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any wonder, then,&#8221; sighed Ruth,
&#8220;that we find it so hard to make her register affection
for Mr. Grand? And she already should
have learned to do that in that first picture we
took out West.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s the reason,&#8221; said Helen wickedly.
&#8220;If she did not know Mr. Grand&#8217;s foibles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
so well, she might the better show interest in him.
Goodness knows he&#8217;s handsome enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better than that, he can act,&#8221; said Ruth
thoughtfully. &#8220;Not many of these handsome
screen heroes can do that. But perhaps if Wonota
did not disdain him so much (and she does, secretly)
she could play up to him better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there much more for her to do?&#8221; Helen
asked, with renewed interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Several scenes&mdash;and some of them most important.
Mr. Hooley can not give all his time
to her. I am trying to coach her in them. But
there is so much going on here at the island&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not take her away to some other place
and just pound it into her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to the Kingdom of Pipes!&#8221; laughed Ruth
suddenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Let the old pirate have that place to his
heart&#8217;s content. But there are other islands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;True enough. Fourteen hundred of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; exclaimed the energetic Helen.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s get Willie and the <i>Gem</i> and go somewhere
with Wonota. You&#8217;ve all day to hammer at her.
Get your continuity and try to get it into Wonota&#8217;s
head that she is deeply and desperately in love
with Grand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In spite of Helen&#8217;s brusk way of speaking,
Ruth decided that her idea might be well worth
following. Helen took some knitting and a parasol&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
a hamper. Ruth gathered her necessary
books and script; and likewise got Wonota. Then
they boarded the launch and Willie took them up
the river to a tiny islet not far from the Kingdom
of Pipes, after all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anybody moving over there,&#8221;
Helen remarked, as Willie landed them at the
islet selected. She was looking at the island on
which Ruth had had her adventure with the King
of the Pipes. &#8220;It looks deserted enough. We
might have gone there just as well as not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as well satisfied to keep away from that
queer old fellow,&#8221; her chum said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Willie, the boatman,
overhearing their remarks.
</p>
<p>Ruth told him about the strange man, and Willie
laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! That old jigger? Was he the fellow the
boss wanted we should shoo off that island? Why
didn&#8217;t he say so? Old Charley-Horse Pond. We
all know him about here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Helen. &#8220;Is he crazy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not enough to make any difference. Just
got a twist in his brain. Calls himself a king,
does he? Mebbe he will be a duke or an emperor
next time. Or a doctor. Can&#8217;t tell. He gets
fancies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And of course he is not dangerous?&#8221; said
Ruth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just about as dangerous as a fly,&#8221; drawled
Willie. &#8220;And not so much. For flies bite&mdash;sometimes,
and old Charley-Horse Pond ain&#8217;t even got
teeth to bite with. No, Ma&#8217;am!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what are the &#8216;pipes&#8217; he talks about? Why
&#8216;King of the Pipes&#8217;?&#8221; demanded the insistent
Helen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Got me. Never heard of &#8217;em,&#8221; declared
Willie. &#8220;Now, you ladies all right here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Willie,&#8221; said Ruth as the <i>Gem</i> was
backed off the island.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come for you at half past three, eh?
That&#8217;s all right, then,&#8221; and the boatman was off.
</p>
<p>The three girls, really glad to be away from
the crowd and the confusion of the moving picture
camp, settled down to several hours of companionship.
Helen could be silent if she pleased, and
with her knitting and a novel proceeded to curl
up under a tamarack tree and bury herself for
the time being.
</p>
<p>Helen had not, however, forgotten the &#8220;inner
woman,&#8221; as she pronounced it. When lunch time
came she opened the covered basket which she
had brought in addition to the book and the knitting,
and produced sandwiches and cake, besides
the wherewithal for the making of a cup of tea
over a can of solidified alcohol. They lunched
famously.
</p>
<p>It was while they were thus engaged, and chatting,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
that the staccato exhaust of a motor-boat
drew their attention to the Island of Pipes. From
the other side, a boat was poking around into the
passage leading to the American shore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness!&#8221; exclaimed Helen, &#8220;the King
of the Pipes isn&#8217;t in that boat, is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; Ruth assured her. &#8220;I see nobody
who looks like him among those men&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All are not men, Miss Ruth,&#8221; interrupted
Wonota, the keen-eyed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Wonota?&#8221; gasped Helen,
whirling around to gaze again at the passing
launch.
</p>
<p>But Ruth did not say a word. She had been
examining the boat closely. She saw it was the
very speedy boat she and Chess Copley had seen
out on the wider part of the river several weeks
before. The launch was not moving rapidly now,
but Ruth was sure that it was a powerful craft.
</p>
<p>It was Helen who marked the figure Wonota
had spoken of in the boat. It certainly did not
appear to be a man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Ruth! See! That is a woman!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A yellow-faced lady,&#8221; said Wonota calmly.
&#8220;I saw her first, Miss Ruth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All three of the girls on the island stared after
the moving motor-boat. Ruth saw the woman.
She was dressed plainly but in modern garments.
She did not seem to be one of the summer visitors
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
to the islands. Indeed, her clothing&mdash;such as
could be seen&mdash;pointed to city breeding, but nothing
was chosen, it would seem, for wear in such
a place as this. She might have been on a ferryboat
going from shore to shore of the Hudson!
</p>
<p>&#8220;She <i>is</i> a yellow lady,&#8221; Wonota repeated
earnestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say she was!&#8221; exclaimed Helen.
&#8220;What do you think of her, Ruth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I do not know what to say,&#8221; the
girl of the Red Mill answered. &#8220;Does she look
like a white woman to you, Helen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is yellow,&#8221; reiterated Wonota.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She certainly is not an Indian,&#8221; observed
Helen. &#8220;What say, Ruth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She surely is not,&#8221; agreed her chum.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A yellow lady,&#8221; murmured Wonota again, as
the boat drew behind another island and there
remained out of sight.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>MAROONED</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if the boat did come from that island
over yonder?&#8221; Ruth murmured, after a few
moments of thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake! what are you worrying
about?&#8221; asked Helen Cameron.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worrying at all,&#8221; Ruth returned, smiling.
&#8220;But I am curious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About that yellow lady?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About what happens on that island the queer
old man lives on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know that he really lives there,&#8221;
was the prompt rejoinder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so. He may not be there now.
But&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But me no buts, unless you mean to go on,&#8221;
said Helen, as Ruth hesitated again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does seem queer,&#8221; said Ruth thoughtfully.
&#8220;Other people go there besides the King of the
Pipes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! We all went there when that allegory
was staged.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And since then,&#8221; said Ruth, and proceeded to
tell the two girls what she and Chess Copley had
seen early one morning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Men landing boxes on the island?&#8221; cried
Helen, while Wonota merely looked puzzled.
&#8220;There is a camp there, like enough. And those
men&mdash;and the woman&mdash;in the launch might have
come from there, of course. When Willie comes
back for us, let&#8217;s sail around the island and see
if we can spy where their tent is set up. For
of course there is no house there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom and I found no habitation when we went
to search for the old man,&#8221; admitted Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. It must be a tent, then,&#8221; said her
chum with conviction. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But as it turned out, they made no such search
that day. Indeed, Willie and the <i>Gem</i> did not
return for them. The camp launch was not the
first craft that appeared. Ruth was again coaching
Wonota after lunch when Helen spied something
on the water that caused her to cry out,
drawing the other girls&#8217; attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who under the sun is this coming in the
canoe?&#8221; Helen demanded. &#8220;Why! he is making
it fairly fly. I never!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wonota scarcely glanced in the direction of the
distant moving picture camp, and she said composedly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Chief Totantora. He comes for me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>The Indian in the canoe caused the craft to tear
through the water. No such paddling had the
two white girls ever seen before. Not a motion
was lost on the part of Chief Totantora. Every
stroke of his paddle drove the craft on with a speed
to make anybody marvel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something has happened!&#8221; gasped Ruth, standing
up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He comes for me,&#8221; repeated Wonota, still
calmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; queried Helen, quite as much disturbed
now as her chum.
</p>
<p>Before the Indian girl could have answered&mdash;had
she intended to explain&mdash;the canoe came close
in to the bank of the island, was swerved dexterously,
and Totantora leaped ashore&mdash;a feat not at
all easy to perform without overturning the canoe.
It scarcely rocked.
</p>
<p>He stooped and held it from scraping against
the rock, and shot up at his daughter several brief
sentences in their own tongue. He paid no attention
to Ruth, even, although she stepped forward
and asked what his errand was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go, Miss Ruth,&#8221; said Wonota quickly.
&#8220;Mr. Hammond has sent him. It was arranged
before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was arranged?&#8221; demanded Ruth, with
some sharpness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going yonder,&#8221; she pointed to the hazy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
shore of Grenadier Island that was in view from
where they stood. &#8220;It is said by Mr. Hammond
that yonder the man with the little green eyes&mdash;the
fat man&mdash;cannot have us taken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake!&#8221; gasped Helen, &#8220;she&#8217;s
talking of that Bilby, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it mean? Has Bilby come again?&#8221;
cried Ruth, speaking directly to Totantora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We go,&#8221; said the chief. &#8220;Hammond, he say
so. Now. They come for me and for Wonota
with talking papers from the white man&#8217;s court.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Mr. Hammond&#8217;s lawyer could not do all
Mr. Hammond expected,&#8221; sighed Ruth. &#8220;The
picture will be ruined.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of such a thing,&#8221; cried Helen
angrily. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to know what sort of courts
and judges they have up here in these woods?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Ruth wanted to know more. She held
Wonota back as she would have stepped into the
canoe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; she urged. &#8220;Tell me more, Totantora.
Where are you taking Wonota?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the Indian girl who answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Over on that shore,&#8221; said she, pointing again to
the Canadian island, &#8220;these courts cannot touch us.
Mr. Hammond told my father so. We go there
to wait until the trouble is over. Mr. Hammond
spoke of it before. Totantora is informed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it means delay and expense,&#8221; cried Ruth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How mean!&#8221; exploded Helen. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to do
something to that Bilby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you money&mdash;plenty of money?&#8221; Ruth demanded
of the Indian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have money,&#8221; said Wonota, touching the
bosom of her blouse. &#8220;We do not need much.
We shall live quietly there until Mr. Hammond
sends for us. We will be faithful to you, Miss
Ruth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned, with more impulsiveness than she
usually showed, and kissed the white girl&#8217;s cheek.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are so good to me!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I will
not forget all you have taught me. And I will
rehearse every day so to be perfect when Mr.
Hooley wants me again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no way to stop her. Indeed, as Mr.
Hammond had advised this sudden move, Ruth
knew she had no right to interfere. It was evident
that an emergency had arisen of which she, herself,
knew nothing. In some way the enemy had forced
Mr. Hammond&#8217;s hand. Totantora and his daughter
were in danger of being brought into court after
all, and Mr. Hammond did not wish that to
come about.
</p>
<p>The Indian girl stepped lightly into the canoe
and picked up the extra paddle. Her father leaped
in after her, pushed the light craft away from
the rock, and seized his own paddle. In another
moment the canoe shot away from the island and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
off toward the broad expanse of the open St.
Lawrence.
</p>
<p>Helen and Ruth stared after them&mdash;then at each
other. Naturally it was Helen who first regained
her voice and gave expression to her amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about that?&#8221; she demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what to say,&#8221; murmured Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I know what to say, all right,&#8221; said the
disgusted Helen. &#8220;It&#8217;s no joke.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth herself admitted it was nothing to laugh
about. She saw difficulties in the way of the
completion of &#8220;The Long Lane&#8217;s Turning&#8221; of
which Helen knew but little&mdash;or of which she did
not think.
</p>
<p>Ruth knew that there were scenes&mdash;some of
them she had been studying with Wonota this day&mdash;that
could not be changed nor eliminated.
Wonota must be in them. No &#8220;double&#8221; could be
used.
</p>
<p>In the first place, the Indian girl&#8217;s personality
was distinct. It could not easily be matched.
</p>
<p>Ruth knew that, even at that time, one of the
most popular screen actresses, because of her inability
longer to look the child, was using a double
for all her &#8220;close-ups&#8221; when she was forced to
play those childish parts that a hungry public of
&#8220;movie fans&#8221; demanded.
</p>
<p>Nothing like this would save &#8220;The Long Lane&#8217;s
Turning.&#8221; The throne room scene in Paris, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
was yet to be photographed, was too delicate a
matter to put in the hands of any double. Wonota
was herself&mdash;even in this picture she was a distinct
personality&mdash;and she must be shown to the very
end of the last reel and the last &#8220;fade-out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The thoughts caused Ruth to feel very, very
sober. Helen looked at her with some appreciation
of her chum&#8217;s despair; yet she could not appreciate
the situation in full.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the lighter-minded Helen leaped to her
feet from the bank on which she was sitting, and
exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness, Ruth! do you realize that we are
marooned?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marooned?&#8221; was the wondering rejoiner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Just as though we had been put ashore
here by a crew of mutineers and deserted&mdash;a pair
of Robinson Crusoesses!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your English&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bother my English!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would surely bother Mrs. Tellingham&mdash;if
she could hear it, poor dear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t sidetrack me,&#8221; remarked Helen.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see we are cast away on this desert
isle with no means of getting back to the camp unless
we swim?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Willie will be after us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, will &#8217;e?&#8221; asked the roguish Helen, punning
on the boatman&#8217;s name.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do be sensible&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Even good sense will not rescue us,&#8221; interrupted
Helen. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to get back to camp and
hear all the exciting details. Totantora certainly
can say less in a few moments than any person I
ever saw. And Wonota is not much better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does not matter how much they said or how
little. The fat is all in the fire, I guess,&#8221; groaned
Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chirk up! Something is sure to turn up, I suppose.
We won&#8217;t be left here to starve,&#8221; and
Helen&#8217;s eyes flashed her fun.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>you</i>!&#8221; began Ruth, half laughing too.
Then she stopped and held up her hand. &#8220;What&#8217;s
that?&#8221; she whispered.
</p>
<p>The sound was repeated. A long-drawn
&#8220;co-ee! co-ee!&#8221; which drained away into the depths
of the forest-covered islands all about them. They
were not where they could see a single isle known
to be inhabited.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is calling us?&#8221; demanded Helen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; commanded Ruth. &#8220;That is not for
us. I have heard it before. It comes from the
King of the Pipes&#8217; island&mdash;to be sure it does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s calling for help!&#8221; gasped Helen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is doing nothing of the kind. It is a signal.&#8221;
Ruth told Helen swiftly more of that early
morning incident she and Chess Copley had observed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
when they saw the boxes carried ashore
from the motor-boat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me,&#8221; grumbled Helen, &#8220;you have a
lot of adventures with &#8217;Lasses Copley, Ruth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your own fault that you don&#8217;t,&#8221; returned her
chum promptly. &#8220;You could have been along.
But you don&#8217;t like Mr. Copley.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What has that to do with it?&#8221; rejoined Helen
smartly. &#8220;I would go adventuring with any boy&mdash;even
&#8217;Lasses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call him that,&#8221; commanded Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! He likes it. Or he used to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a nice fellow,&#8221; Ruth declared, with more
earnestness than there really seemed to be necessity
for.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;de-clare!&#8221; murmured Helen. &#8220;Really!
Does the wind sit in that quarter?&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A DETERMINATION</h3>
</div>

<p>However the wind might sit and whatever may
have been her secret opinion of Ruth Fielding&#8217;s interest
in Chessleigh Copley, Helen suddenly became
mute regarding that young man.
</p>
<p>But, after a moment, she was not at all mute
upon the subject of the King of the Pipes and what
might be going on on the island where they believed
the queer old man had his headquarters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it should be smugglers over there&mdash;only
fancy!&#8221; sighed Helen ecstatically. &#8220;Diamonds
and silks and lots of precious things! My, oh,
my!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better than pirates?&#8221; laughed Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Consider!&#8221; cried her chum boldly. &#8220;I said
that island looked like a pirate&#8217;s den from the
start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your fore-sight-hind-sight is wonderful,&#8221; declared
Ruth, shaking her head and making big eyes
at her friend.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t laugh&mdash;Oh! What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>From over the water, and unmistakably from the
rocky island on the summit of which the blasted
beech stood&mdash;a prominent landmark&mdash;came the
strange cry, &#8220;co-ee! co-ee!&#8221; which they had heard
before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose that poor old man is calling
for help?&#8221; hesitated Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your grandmother&#8217;s aunt!&#8221; ejaculated Helen,
in disgust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We-ell that is even a more roundabout relationship
than that between Aunt Alvirah Boggs
and me. Poor old soul, she is nobody&#8217;s relation,
as she often says, but everybody&#8217;s aunt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There goes the signal again, and here comes
that boat!&#8221; exclaimed Helen suddenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What boat?&#8221; demanded Ruth, looking in the
direction of the distant Canadian island, toward
which the canoe, with Totantora and Wonota in
it, had now disappeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn around&mdash;do!&#8221; exclaimed Helen. &#8220;This
way. That is the same boat we saw going by some
time ago. The boat with the yellow lady in it,
as Wonota called her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is very strange,&#8221; murmured Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the yellow lady is not with those men now,&#8221;
said Helen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not see any woman aboard,&#8221; admitted her
friend.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>The boat&mdash;going not so fast now&mdash;crossed their
line of vision and finally rounded the end of the
island on which the two chums believed the queer
old man resided. At least, somebody had uttered
the strange, shrill cry from that very spot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! If we were not marooned here!&#8221;
grumbled Helen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we had a boat&mdash;even a canoe&mdash;we could
follow that motor-launch and see if those pirates
make a landing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pirates!&#8221; repeated Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Smugglers, then. Your own Chess Copley
says they may be smugglers, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would not speak in that way,
Helen,&#8221; objected Ruth. &#8220;He is not my Chess
Copley&mdash;&mdash;or anything else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he certainly isn&#8217;t mine,&#8221; retorted Helen,
with more gaiety. &#8220;I can&#8217;t say I approve of him&mdash;and
I long since told you why.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are unfair, Helen,&#8221; said Ruth
seriously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! if you don&#8217;t care anything about him,
why are you so anxious to have me change my
opinion of &#8217;Lasses?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For your own sake,&#8221; said her friend shortly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder! For <i>my</i> sake?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Because you are not naturally unfair&mdash;and
Chess feels it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he does, does he?&#8221; snapped Helen. &#8220;I
hope he does. Let him feel!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This heartless observation closed Ruth&#8217;s lips on
the subject. The two girls watched the other island.
They did not see the boat again. Nor did
they see anybody on the island or hear any other
cry from there.
</p>
<p>They both began to grow anxious. No boat appeared
from the direction of the camp, and it was
past the hour now when Willie was to have called
for them with the <i>Gem</i>. Why didn&#8217;t he come?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, Mr. Hammond doesn&#8217;t expect us
to swim home,&#8221; complained Helen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something must have occurred. Totantora&#8217;s
being sent off so suddenly really worries me. Perhaps
Mr. Hammond himself was obliged to leave
the camp and perhaps he went in the <i>Gem</i>, and
Willie cannot return for us until later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But where is Tom? Surely he must know all
about this sudden trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was Tom going to do to-day?&#8221; asked
Ruth quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s so! I had forgotten,&#8221; said Tom&#8217;s
sister, in despair. &#8220;He was going around to Oak
Point with some of the men. That&#8217;s down the
river, beyond Chippewa Point, and they could
scarcely get back in the other motor-boat before
dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the answer, I guess,&#8221; sighed Ruth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then we are marooned!&#8221; ejaculated Helen.
&#8220;I do think it is too mean&mdash;and my goodness! we
ate every crumb of lunch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The two &#8216;Robinson Crusoesses,&#8217; then, may
have to go on short rations,&#8221; but Ruth said it with
a smile. &#8220;I guess we are not in any real danger
of starvation, however.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same, a joke can easily become serious
when one is deserted on a desert island.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you were looking for adventure,&#8221; retorted
Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you have it,&#8221; said Ruth, but soberly.
&#8220;And worrying about it will not help us a particle.
Might as well be cheerful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are as full of old saws as a carpenter&#8217;s
abandoned tool-chest,&#8221; said Helen smartly. &#8220;Oh!
What is this I hear? The smuggler&#8217;s boat
again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They did hear a motor, but no boat appeared
from the other side of the Kingdom of Pipes. The
sound drew nearer. The motor-boat was coming
down the river, through a passage between the island
where the girls were and the American side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on! I don&#8217;t care who it is,&#8221; cried Helen,
starting to run through the bushes. &#8220;We&#8217;ll hail
them and ask them for rescue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But when she came in sight of the craft, to
Ruth&#8217;s surprise Helen did not at once shout. Ruth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
only saw the bow of the boat coming down stream
herself; but suddenly she marked the small name-board
with its gilt lettering:
</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lauriette</span></p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Chess, I do believe!&#8221; she cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; grumbled Helen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Helen Cameron!&#8221; gasped Ruth, &#8220;are
you going to be foolish enough to refuse to be
taken off this island by Chessleigh Copley?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t say I was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t be unkind to him!&#8221; pleaded Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem so terribly fond of him that I guess
he won&#8217;t mind how I treat him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know better,&#8221; Ruth told her admonishingly.
&#8220;Chess thinks a great deal of you, while
you treat him too unkindly for utterance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d better not think of me too much,&#8221; said
Helen scornfully. &#8220;His head won&#8217;t stand it.
Tom says &#8217;Lasses never was strong in the deeper
strata of college learning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth was not to be drawn into any controversy.
She called to the young man when, dressed in flannels
and standing at his wheel and engine, he came
into view.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Here&#8217;s good luck!&#8221; shouted Chess,
swerving the bow of the <i>Lauriette</i> in toward the
island instantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Glad you think it&#8217;s good luck,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
Helen sulkily. &#8220;I guess you never were marooned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s navy blue you&#8217;ve got on&mdash;not maroon,&#8221;
said Chess soberly. &#8220;Do you suppose I
am color-blind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Smarty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, children, this is too serious a matter to
quarrel over,&#8221; admonished Ruth, but smiling because
her chum showed, after all, interest enough
in the young man to be &#8220;scrappy.&#8221; &#8220;What do you
suppose we have seen, Chess?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know first of all how you came here
without a boat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness, yes!&#8221; gasped Helen. &#8220;I&#8217;d almost
forgotten about Wonota and Totantora.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth shook her head. &#8220;I am not likely to forget
that,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>She explained to the young man as they got into
the launch and he pushed out from the shore about
the difficulty that had arisen over the Indians. He
was naturally deeply interested in Ruth&#8217;s trouble
and in the fate of the Indians. But on top of that
Helen eagerly told about the speedy launch, the
yellow lady, and their suspicions regarding what
was going on at the island that they had nicknamed
the Kingdom of Pipes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you what,&#8221; Chess said, quite as eagerly
as Helen, &#8220;I was coming over to take you all for
a sail on the river to-night. Let&#8217;s get Tom and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
just us four keep watch on that island. I believe
there is something going on there that ought to
be looked into.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know that it is our business to look
into it,&#8221; suggested Ruth, doubtfully.
</p>
<p>But for once Helen agreed with Chess, and
against Ruth&#8217;s better judgment it was determined
to come back to this locality after dinner and lurk
about the mysterious island in the Copley launch.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>BILBY&#8217;S TRUMP CARD</h3>
</div>

<p>Naturally, Ruth went in search of Mr. Hammond
the moment she landed on the island where
the moving picture company was established. But,
as she saw that the <i>Gem</i> was not at the dock, she
scarcely expected to find the president of the company
at hand&mdash;and in that expectation she was not
mistaken.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hooley, the director, however, told her
what he knew about the occurrence that had started
Totantora so madly from the island in the canoe.
Bilby and whoever it was that backed him in his
enterprise were evidently determined to obtain the
services of Wonota, the Osage princess, if it could
be brought about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me,&#8221; said the director, &#8220;as though we
were going to have some trouble finishing this picture,
Miss Fielding.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t finish it without Wonota!&#8221; cried the
girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think you could rewrite the remaining
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
scenes so that we can keep on to the conclusion?&#8221;
he asked thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Hooley! How about the throne-room
scene? Wonota must appear in that. You
say yourself that we cannot use anybody in her
place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about cutting out that scene? Finish the
play on this side of the water. Don&#8217;t go to France
at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the picture is spoiled!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No picture is spoiled until it goes out of our
hands, you know,&#8221; and Mr. Hooley smiled satirically.
&#8220;You know how it is in the picture business,
Miss Fielding. Some unfortunate producer
buys a script or a story. The scenario writer
&#8216;saves&#8217; the story by his work on the script. Then
the continuity man &#8216;saves&#8217; it a second time. Then
the director &#8216;saves&#8217; it after he gets it into his
hands. We know that the star performer always
&#8216;saves&#8217; it again. And then the film cutter and the
title writer each &#8216;save&#8217; it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most pictures are &#8216;saved&#8217; in this way by the
omniscience of all who work on it so that, when it
is finally produced, the writer seldom recognizes
more than a glimmer of his original idea in the final
product.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are much better treated than most picture
writers, you know very well. And here you have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
a chance to &#8216;save&#8217; your own work,&#8221; and Mr.
Hooley finished with a laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no laughing matter,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;I
wanted this to be a really big picture. And I do
not want to cut out Wonota. Without that
throne-room scene it will fall flat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We should have taken it in New York,&#8221; grumbled
Mr. Hooley. &#8220;I felt it at the time. But
Mr. Hammond contracted for so many weeks&#8217;
use of this island and the time is running out already.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Wonota and Totantora are gone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where they have gone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t the least idea. But Mr. Hammond
knows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He went to town?&#8221; asked Ruth thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has gone to confer with the lawyers and
see if they can get the court to vacate the injunction
issued against our use of Wonota. Bilby and the
sheriff came again. They had a warrant this time.
It called for the production of Wonota. Luckily
you had her off the island at the time. They
searched every nook and cranny, and meanwhile
Totantora got away. They wanted him too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that Bilby is too mean for words!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I take it that it was his trump card. He
must have some powerful influence behind him.
But&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But what, Mr. Hooley?&#8221; asked Ruth eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see how we might get over the difficulty
if the courts will not listen to reason.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Do tell me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can move the whole company over the
Canadian border, and before Bilby can do anything
over there we&#8217;ll have finished &#8216;The Long
Lane&#8217;s Turning.&#8217; That&#8217;s the only way I see out
of the mess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But think of the expense!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! I&#8217;m thinking of that all the time,&#8221; grumbled
Hooley. &#8220;And don&#8217;t you forget that the
boss never allows me to lose sight of it. Your interest
in this picture is greater than mine, Miss
Fielding; but my job is sort of tangled up in it,
too. Mr. Hammond is a good man; but he is a
good business man first of all. I am afraid that
you will be obliged to make some changes in the
remaining scenes so as to overcome the difficulty of
losing Wonota.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not do it!&#8221; cried the girl, this time in
anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better read your contract. If you won&#8217;t do
it, somebody else will have to. You know, we&#8217;ve
got a man at the studio who could change Hamlet
into a slap-stick comedy over night, if the emergency
arose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not agree to have my picture ruined,&#8221;
said Ruth, almost in tears.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t the way to look at it,&#8221; Hooley observed
more kindly. &#8220;Just see that you save your
story yourself instead of letting some other person
do it for you. That&#8217;s the answer, I fear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth had no appetite for dinner that evening,
but she was obliged to meet her friends and the
actors and actresses who ate at her table with at
least an appearance of cheerfulness.
</p>
<p>It was impressed upon her mind more deeply
than ever before, however, that her arrangement
with the Alectrion Film Corporation was not
wholly satisfactory. She had learned so much
now about the making of a screen picture that often
her advice in the directing of the action was
accepted with admiration by Mr. Hooley. Mr.
Hammond was not afraid to go away and leave
the two to film the most important scenes in a
script.
</p>
<p>And why should she be tied to certain agreements
that cramped her? Especially in a case of
this kind. For the sake of saving expense Mr.
Hammond was likely to insist that the artistic part
of &#8220;The Long Lane&#8217;s Turning&#8221; should be sacrificed.
</p>
<p>Ruth felt that on her part she would spend
twenty-five thousand dollars more (if she had it
to spend) in shipping the whole company over
the border and making the remainder of the picture
in Canada.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to be in a position some time where
I shall have the say as to every detail of the picture,&#8221;
she told herself. &#8220;I want to be my own
manager and my own producer. Otherwise I
shall never be happy&mdash;nor will I ever be sure of
making worth-while pictures.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For Ruth took this career of hers very seriously
indeed. Because she did so, perhaps, the fact
that Tom Cameron seemed to consider his work
so lightly caused Ruth to criticise the young man
harshly. That could only be expected.
</p>
<p>Tom did not return for dinner. Nor did Mr.
Hammond come back to headquarters. Chess
Copley was eager to get the girls out in his <i>Lauriette</i>
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! it&#8217;s nothing much, I guess,&#8221; said Helen,
seemingly having lost her first interest in the smugglers
and the King of the Pipes. &#8220;And, anyway,
I shall not go unless Tom is with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Helen!&#8221; cried Ruth, &#8220;I thought you were
so eager.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps. If Tom went.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we promised Chess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You promised him. He wants to do it because
you are going.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Helen, you know&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know just what I am saying. I have no interest
in &#8217;Lasses Copley. You have.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are the most exasperating girl!&#8221; exclaimed
Ruth, in some warmth.
</p>
<p>They were in their room freshening their toilets
for the evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to suit you any more than Tom
does,&#8221; said her chum coolly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare, Helen! you go too far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t go too far this time&mdash;without Tom.&#8221;
Helen laughed in a provoking way. &#8220;You can
run along with your Chessleigh if you like. Not
me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just what I will do,&#8221; said Ruth quietly,
but with flashing eyes. &#8220;I would not insult him
by refusing&mdash;now. I will tell him you have a
headache and cannot come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do as you like,&#8221; was the ungracious reply.
&#8220;You are crazy about Chess, I guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are jealous, Helen Cameron!&#8221;
cried Ruth, in wonder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I should be,&#8221; returned Helen
lightly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve no interest in Chess Copley. And
I haven&#8217;t had since&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since when, I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since I found him out. So now! That&#8217;s
enough. I am not going. Unless, of course,
Tom returns and wants me to go along with you
and Chess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>What more was there to say? Ruth did not
wish to disappoint Chessleigh. She felt that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
Helen Cameron had no reason for treating the
young man as she did.
</p>
<p>So, as she had done before, and without much
interest in the evening sailing party, Ruth left the
bungalow to join the waiting Chessleigh at the
dock.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>SUSPENSE</h3>
</div>

<p>Tom and his party in the other motor-boat had
not appeared, nor had the <i>Gem</i> come back from
the town of Chippewa Bay with Mr. Hammond.
Why should not Ruth and Chessleigh spy about
among the islands for a time?
</p>
<p>It was not now moonlight; and there was some
haze which gave a smouldering effect to the stars
peering through it. But these soft, hazy nights
had their own charm and Ruth had come to love
them.
</p>
<p>Especially on the water. Amid the tamarack-clothed
islets the motor-boats crept in and out in
a delightful way. To lie on the cushions in
the cockpit of the <i>Lauriette</i> and bask in the pearly
starlight was an experience the girl from Cheslow
was not likely to forget.
</p>
<p>To-night, when the <i>Lauriette</i> got away from
the moving picture camp, there were no other
boats in sight. Chess dimmed his lights and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
craft crept through the narrow passages between
the islands, heading up stream.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My idea,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is to land at the back of
that island&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Kingdom of Pipes?&#8221; interrupted Ruth in
surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Where you say you landed before&mdash;twice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is, if we see nothing or nobody about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d better take any great risk&mdash;only
two of us,&#8221; observed Ruth, with her usual
caution.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, we won&#8217;t walk right into danger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should hope not! And just what are we going
for, anyway?&#8221; and she suddenly laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m curious about those fellows,&#8221; said
the young man. &#8220;And I thought you were.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m curious about the King of the Pipes.
Charley-Horse Pond, Willie calls him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer old boy, I guess,&#8221; admitted Chess. &#8220;But
I want to know more about those chaps who unloaded
the boxes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What could have been in the boxes? Surely
there is no camping party on that island. At least,
no pleasure party.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy not. If you ask me about the boxes,
I am puzzled. Yet, I&#8217;ve a glimmer of an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
idea&mdash;Are you sure that was a woman with them to-day in
their boat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonota called her the yellow lady. And
Wonota has good eyes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With a yellow face, yes? And we saw a
Chinaman in the boat that other time on the
river,&#8221; said Chess quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely she wasn&#8217;t a Chinese woman? Yet, she
might have been.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese women aren&#8217;t usually smuggled over
the border, I guess,&#8221; muttered the young fellow.
&#8220;But Chinese men are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we should have reported it to the authorities,&#8221;
Ruth suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until we are sure there is really something
wrong. I don&#8217;t want to be laughed at, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Ruth just then had considered another
phase of the matter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;There&#8217;s Bilby! He was in
it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that boat when we first saw it. When we
saw the Chinaman, you know, out on the Canadian
side of the river. If there is anything wrong
about these men&mdash;and the King of the Pipes&mdash;Bilby
is mixed up with them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you are right, Ruth. Maybe that fellow
is into more queer games than just trying to
grab your Osage princess.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But more than that,&#8221; said Ruth much worried
now, &#8220;he may have so many friends on the Canadian
side that he can trace Wonota and her father
over there on Grenadier Island.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better warn Mr. Hammond when he comes
back from town,&#8221; suggested her friend. &#8220;That
Bilby seems to be universally troublesome. I&#8217;ll
say he is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They kept quiet after that, for the outline of the
rocky island, with the blasted beech visible at its
summit, came into view. Nothing stirred upon the
island, nor was there any other boat in sight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had we better venture ashore?&#8221; breathed
Ruth, again in doubt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on. Let&#8217;s try it. I&#8217;ve got an electric
torch in my pocket. We can find our way all over
the island with that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was true that the girl of the Red Mill felt
some trepidation, but she had confidence in her
companion&#8217;s muscle and courage if not in his caution.
Besides, she was very curious about the
queer old man and the doings on his island.
</p>
<p>Chess shut off the engine of the <i>Lauriette</i> some
distance from the island; but first he had gone
above the rocky landing, so that the sluggish current
between the islands drifted the motor-boat
back upon that strand.
</p>
<p>He went forward and, with a line in his hand,
leaped ashore the moment he could do so, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
drew the <i>Lauriette</i> in to the rock. Then he passed
the line around the very sapling to which Ruth
had once fastened the canoe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; he whispered, offering his hand
to the girl.
</p>
<p>She leaped ashore. They were both wearing
canvas, rubber-soled, low shoes which made no
noise on the stones. Chess drew forth the electric
torch and tried it, turning the spot of light on the
ground at their feet. It worked perfectly.
</p>
<p>In his right-hand jacket pocket he carried an
entirely different article, but he did not mention
that fact to Ruth. She would not have gone with
him had she known of the presence of the pistol.
The possession of firearms would have, to her
mind, at once taken the matter out of the realm
of mere adventure into that of peril, and Ruth
was not seeking such an experience.
</p>
<p>She only half believed in the smugglers. She
had seen some men in a boat at the island, but
she doubted if it meant anything more than a
fishing party. Those boxes taken ashore meant
nothing much to her, if they did suggest some
particularly interesting situation to Chess.
</p>
<p>In fact, Copley had not fully taken Ruth into
his confidence. He had reason to suspect that
whoever might be on this island were law-breakers,
and he really had no right to bring Ruth here.
Tom Cameron would not have done it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>Copley was serious, however, in his intention
of finding out if possible who was on the island;
and when they had passed up the rough path to
the round table-stone, Ruth had got over her little
shivery feeling and was as eager as Chess himself.
</p>
<p>They passed carefully through the fringe of
brush and reached the open space where the
blasted beech tree stood. The faint starlight illumined
the space, so that Chess did not need
to use the torch in his left hand. There was no
tent set up here nor any other mark of human
habitation.
</p>
<p>Ruth knew that there was scarcely any other
place on the island where a camp could be established.
Had the people they had seen landing
from the speedy launch gone away for good and
taken their camp equipment with them?
</p>
<p>Suddenly Copley seized her wrist. His touch
was cold and betrayed the fact that he was nervous
himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; he whispered, his lips close to Ruth&#8217;s
ear.
</p>
<p>Helen would have immediately been &#8220;in a
fidget,&#8221; and said so. But Ruth could restrain
herself pretty well. She nodded so that Copley
saw she heard him and was listening. They
waited several moments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; breathed the young fellow again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Ruth ventured.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody talking. Listen!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a human voice near by. It sounded
close to them, and yet its direction Ruth could
not decide upon. There was a hollow, reverberating
quality to the sounds that baffled determination
as to their origin. But it was a human voice without
doubt.
</p>
<p>Ruth could not, however, understand a word
that was spoken. The tones were first high, then
low, never guttural, and possessed a certain sibilant
quality. Whether the words spoken were
English or not, was likewise a mystery.
</p>
<p>Ruth and Chessleigh stood first in one
place, then in another, in that circle about the
big beech tree. The young man had gone all
around the tattered trunk and found no opening.
If it was hollow, there was no way of getting into
it near the ground, nor was there any ladder by
which one might scale the huge trunk to the top.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no hide-away,&#8221; mouthed Chess, his
lips close at Ruth&#8217;s ear again. &#8220;And it seems to
me the sound doesn&#8217;t come from overhead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;More as though it came up from the ground,&#8221;
returned Ruth, in the same low voice. &#8220;Do you
suppose we are standing on the roof of a cavern,
Chess Copley?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be,&#8221; agreed the young fellow. &#8220;But
if it is a cavern, where under the sun is the mouth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
of it? How do they get in or out? It beats my
time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth quickly acknowledged that the mystery
was beyond her comprehension. The sing-song
sounds&mdash;for such they seemed to be&mdash;went on and
on, meaningless for the two listeners, who could
not distinguish a single word.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think that&#8217;s your King of the Pipes?&#8221; asked
Chessleigh finally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. If it is, there must be something
more the matter with him than Willie says
there is. He sounds crazy&mdash;that is the way it
sounds to me.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>A FAILURE IN CALCULATION</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do now?&#8221; asked Ruth finally,
and in a whisper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go down to that place where we saw the
boat land the other morning,&#8221; returned her companion.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to look about there a bit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it is wise?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about the wisdom of it,&#8221; chuckled
Chessleigh. &#8220;But I do know that I&#8217;m not at all
satisfied. Some people are here on the island, and
I&#8217;d like to know where they are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid we will get into trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is only that old man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know that it is. He must be talking
to somebody&mdash;if that is his voice we hear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he is only talking to himself. I don&#8217;t
hear anybody else,&#8221; replied the young fellow.
&#8220;Come on. Let&#8217;s see the thing through, now we
have started.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Indeed Ruth wanted to see it through. She
was quite as curious as her companion. So she
made no further objection.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>Pushing through the brush, they climbed carefully
down the slope on the outer side of the
island. The landing where they had fastened
their own boat was on the inner side of the island,
while this side fronted the broad expanse of the
river.
</p>
<p>They could see the hurrying current, glinted
here and there by the soft starlight. Everything
looked ghostly about them. The dim silvery light
made it possible for them to pick their way without
stumbling. They made little noise in reaching
the shore.
</p>
<p>There was a little indention here&mdash;a tiny cove.
The shore was shelving, and of sand and gravel.
Chess pointed silently to the unmistakable marks
of a boat&#8217;s bow in several places.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That boat has been here more than once,&#8221;
he whispered.
</p>
<p>Ruth breathed &#8220;Yes,&#8221; but said no more.
</p>
<p>Up-stream of the cove was a great mass of
rock&mdash;not one rock, but several huddled together
and the cracks between overgrown with brush and
vines. Chess brought into use the electric torch
again.
</p>
<p>He shot the spotlight into the crannies. Was
there a path there between two of the big boulders?
He drew Ruth&#8217;s attention to it with a touch
on her arm. She saw that some of the bushes
were broken&mdash;the vines torn away and dead.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody has been here,&#8221; she murmured.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. That is what we came to find,&#8221;
said the young man. &#8220;We are on the verge of a
discovery, Ruth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we are not on the verge of trouble,&#8221;
she returned, in the same low tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t have a bit of fear,&#8221; he told her, in a
louder voice.
</p>
<p>He was about to mention the loaded pistol in
his pocket; then thought better of it. But he went
ahead, venturing into the narrow passage between
the two boulders.
</p>
<p>The ray of the torch showed the way. It
played on the ground at their feet and upon the
rocky sides of the passage. Was that an abrupt
end to the passage ahead of them, or a sharp turn
in it? Chess pressed on, Ruth trying to peer over
his shoulder, although to do this she had to stand
on tiptoe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By jove!&#8221; uttered the young man in surprise,
&#8220;I believe it is a cavern. It&#8217;s the entrance to a
cave.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then those voices did come from a cavern.
Be careful, Chess&mdash;do!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had reached the turn in the passage. A
jutting shelf of rock roofed them over. The
young man shut off the lamp and they were in
darkness. He thrust forward his head to peer
around the corner.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>As he did so, without the least warning, something
swished through the air and Ruth heard
the sound of a dull blow. Chess pitched forward,
with a groan of pain, falling to his knees.
</p>
<p>Ruth uttered a scream. She did not try to retreat,
but seized the young man by the shoulders
and dragged him back.
</p>
<p>Her brave act saved the young fellow from receiving
a second and heavier blow. A club was
being wielded in the hands of a powerful man who
had met them in the passage!
</p>
<p>Chess was speechless and apparently in a confused
state of mind. The electric torch had fallen
from his hand. He seemed struggling to get
something out of his jacket pocket, but before he
could accomplish this a light flashed up in the
tunnel ahead.
</p>
<p>The same sing-song, chattering voice they had
heard so faintly on the summit of the island broke
out close at hand. In the red, flickering light of
a burning pine torch the frightened girl saw a man
in a broad-brimmed hat and loose, flapping upper
garment bending over Chess with a club again
raised to strike.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurt him! Don&#8217;t hit him again!&#8221; she
cried.
</p>
<p>Other voices&mdash;all speaking in that strange,
sing-song tongue&mdash;broke out, and Ruth suddenly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
realized that these enemies that confronted them
were Chinese.
</p>
<p>In the red light she saw clearly now, under the
round, broad-brimmed hat, the yellow face and
slanting eyes of the man. Ruth did not understand
it&mdash;she could not imagine why these Orientals
should be here on the island. But she realized
fully that the calculations of Copley and herself
had gone astray. They were in peril&mdash;serious
peril.
</p>
<p>The leading Chinaman glared into Ruth&#8217;s
frightened face and his thin lips curled back from
his yellow teeth in a snarl like that of a rabid
dog. His very look was enough to turn the girl
cold. She trembled, still striving to drag the
half-senseless Chessleigh back.
</p>
<p>The Chinaman uttered a long, jabbering howl,
turning his face over his shoulder as though
speaking to those who crowded behind him in the
passage. Ruth might still have escaped, but she
would not desert her injured companion.
</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a stir in the passage and the
big Chinaman was thrust aside. Another figure
pushed forward&mdash;a ragged, bushy-haired figure.
It was the King of the Pipes!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; he commanded in his old way.
</p>
<p>He waved the Chinaman back. He seemed to
have some authority, for the burly Chinaman
obeyed. The old man thrust his face forward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
and peered with his wild eyes into Ruth&#8217;s countenance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;What did I tell you?
I know you, of course. I told you that I could
not divide my kingdom with any one. It was
quite useless for you to come here again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And see what has come of it,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The
Pipes have seen you. They know your intentions.
They will never in this world stand for a divided
kingdom. I shall have to cut off your head.
Too bad! Too bad!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He seized Ruth&#8217;s wrist. She tried to draw away
from him, but he was much more powerful than
she had supposed. One quick jerk and she was
fairly dragged over the crouching figure of Copley
and around the corner of the narrow passage.
</p>
<p>The head Chinaman darted forward and
seized Chess. He likewise was dragged into the
place. Amid the chattering of several high, sing-song
voices, and only half seeing what was being
done because of the flickering torchlight, Ruth
knew that she was being hurried into a tunnel of
some size that ran back into the island.
</p>
<p>It was rocky all about her&mdash;on both sides as
well as under foot and overhead. It was a natural
tunnel, not one made by man. The figures
flitting before her were gnomelike. She saw
clearly only the old man who led her, holding her
tightly by the arm. She knew that the Chinaman
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
was dragging Chess behind them, as though
that unfortunate young man was a sack of potatoes.
</p>
<p>This outcome of their innocent adventure was
entirely different from anything Ruth had dreamed
of. If she did not exactly fear the queer old
man who called himself the King of the Pipes, she
certainly did fear the men who were with him in
this cavern.

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>IN THE CHINESE DEN</h3>
</div>

<p>It was several minutes before Ruth could accustom
her sight to the uncertain, flickering flame
of the torches with which the cavern was illuminated.
There was, too, a small fire on a stone
hearth and above it a stone and cement chimney
that portrayed ingenuity in its building.
</p>
<p>The cavern was a natural one, but man had
made of it a not impossible habitation. She felt
rugs under her feet as she was drawn along by
the King of the Pipes, and when her eyes became
accustomed to the half-gloom of the place she
saw that there were several low tables and a couch
or two, the latter likewise covered with rugs.
</p>
<p>Not only had some ingenuity been expended in
fitting up the cave, but the furnishings must have
occasioned the expenditure of considerable money.
It was not at all the sort of place that she would
have expected the queer old man to occupy on the
lonely island.
</p>
<p>She was so much interested in Chessleigh&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
state, however, that she gave small attention to
these other things. When she could break away
from the King of the Pipes she flung herself down
upon her knees beside the recumbent young man
and raised his head in her arms.
</p>
<p>Chess had received a hard blow from the
Chinaman&#8217;s club. And he had not uttered a word.
The latter fact caused Ruth more alarm than
anything else. She feared that he was very badly
injured, although he was not insensible.
</p>
<p>But there was no blood on his head and face.
She passed her hand swiftly over his crown and
found an unmistakable lump there, a lump raised
by the blow. But, looking more closely into his
half open eyes she saw more intelligence in their
expression than she expected.
</p>
<p>Indeed, as she peered closely at him she distinctly
saw him wink his left eye, and this act,
with the bright look in his eyes, warned her that
Copley was playing possum.
</p>
<p>Having been felled by the blow, and feeling
himself out-matched by the Chinamen who had
come jabbering to the scene, Chess had displayed
much more helplessness than he need have shown.
But Ruth decided that he was very wise to do
this, and she was much relieved to discover this
to be the fact. She did nothing to attract the
attention of their captors to his real condition.
She moaned over him, and made little pitying
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
sounds as though she thought he had been very
seriously hurt by the blow he had received.
</p>
<p>The King of the Pipes put his clawlike hand
upon her shoulder again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him alone. He will have to have his
head off, of course. No hope for it. But I will
try to postpone your decapitation until the thirty-first
day of June, which comes when there are
two Sundays in the same week. Eh? Isn&#8217;t that
shrewd? As King of the Pipes I have to show
great astuteness. Oh, great astuteness!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure you will help us, sire,&#8221; murmured
Ruth, standing up once more and looking appealingly
at the queer old man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I will do what I can. But, remember,
we kings can&#8217;t do what we once could. Seems
to me I told you that before. The war did
the business for us. And I would not dare suggest
taking a consort. The Pipes would never
stand for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom do you call &#8216;the Pipes&#8217;?&#8221; Ruth asked
wonderingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look about you. See them? Already they
are beginning to smoke up again. And it is a
dirty smell. I have to go out and roam about
the island to get away from it. Dreadful! To
give up my throne room to nasty little brass
pipes. Ugh!&#8221;
</p>
<p>While he was speaking the girl stared about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
her, now better able to see the place and the people
in it. There were at least half a dozen men.
And all were Chinamen, as far as she could see, although
not all were dressed in blouse and loose
trousers and wadded slippers&mdash;the usual costume
of the un-westernized Chinaman.
</p>
<p>Two of the men were lying down, and there
were tiny lamps sputtering on the low stools, or
tables, set close to their heads. They held long-stemmed
pipes with small brass bowls, and had
begun to smoke something that had a very pungent
and disagreeable odor.
</p>
<p>Ruth&#8217;s mind had begun to clear. She remembered
the heavy boxes she and Chess had seen
brought ashore, and the Chinaman in the speed
launch, and then the yellow-faced woman being
taken on this very day toward the American shore.
The whole puzzle began to fit together like a piece
of patchwork.
</p>
<p>Chinamen; a high-powered boat going back and
forth across the St. Lawrence; a hidden cave on
this supposedly uninhabited island; the heavy
boxes; the smoking of this vile paste which she
now saw a third Chinaman dip out of a tiny bowl,
on a stick, and drop into his pipe in the form of
a &#8220;pill.&#8221;
</p>
<p><i>Opium!</i>
</p>
<p>If these men&mdash;and the white men of the speed
launch&mdash;did any smuggling it was not diamonds
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
they smuggled. It was opium. And they were
probably running Chinese across the border as
well. Ruth knew that she was in a very serious
predicament when she had swiftly thought this
out, if she had not realized it before.
</p>
<p>What would these evil-looking yellow men do
to her&mdash;and to poor Chess? The latter, she was
relieved to feel, was biding his time. But what
chance was likely to arise which would lead to their
escape from this cavern?
</p>
<p>She looked about the place. Two of the yellow
men were between her and the passage
through which she and her companion had been
dragged. If she wanted to, she could not make
a dash for liberty.
</p>
<p>She turned again to the bedraggled and ragged-haired
old man, curiosity about whom had led
to this predicament. The King of the Pipes was
watching her with eyes that glittered like a bird&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; he whispered, moving nearer again.
&#8220;You cannot escape. The Pipes are very strong
and very agile. They would not let you. To tell
the truth, they fear so much for my safety that
I haven&#8217;t the freedom myself that I would sometimes
like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you leave this place?&#8221; Ruth asked softly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; he warned her in his usual stealthy
way. &#8220;Don&#8217;t speak of it. Of course a king can
do no wrong, and naturally a king can do as he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
pleases. Otherwise, what is kingship? But it
is always well to bow to the peculiarities and the
prejudices of one&#8217;s subjects. They do not like me
to leave the throne-room at certain times. So I
do not attempt to do so. When you met me before,
my dear, there was nobody on the island
but myself. But to-night you see how many are
here, and more yet to come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;More Chinamen?&#8221; she whispered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Perhaps no more of the Pipes,&#8221; and she
thought he showed involuntary disgust of the
opium-smokers. &#8220;But other subjects of mine who
must be catered to. Oh, dear, yes! Being a king
is not all it is cracked up to be, I assure you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For some reason Ruth felt more alarm because
of this last statement of the poor old man than of
anything that had gone before. She realized that
he, of course, really had no influence with the
opium smugglers. But she began to understand
that there were other men coming here who might
be more savage than the Chinamen.
</p>
<p>She remembered that there had been several
white men in the launch when she had observed
it, and that on one occasion Horatio Bilby had been
one of them. Now, Ruth felt not only a great
distaste for Bilby, but she feared him exceedingly.
</p>
<p>It might be that the red-faced fat man who had
so fretted Mr. Hammond and her about Wonota,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
had only crossed the river in the launch as a passenger.
He might have no close connection with
the opium smugglers.
</p>
<p>But knowing Bilby as she did, Ruth could
imagine that he might be mixed up in almost any
illegal business that promised large returns in
money. If he would attempt to steal the Indian
girl, why would he not join hands with opium
smugglers and Chinese runners, if he saw a possibility
of gain in those industries?
</p>
<p>She wished she might talk to Chess and learn
just what was working in his mind at that moment.
She was quite sure that he was by no
means as stunned as he appeared to be.
</p>
<p>She approved of his feigning, for as long as
these men did not seek to injure her, why should
he incur their further notice? He lay on the rug,
quite as though he was helpless; but she knew he
was alert and was ready, if occasion arose, to
show much more agility than the Chinamen or the
old King of the Pipes dreamed.

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE TWINS&#8217; ALARM</h3>
</div>

<p>It was fully an hour after the <i>Lauriette</i> had
chugged away from the dock at the island where
the moving picture company was established that
the motor-boat which had been to Oak Point returned
with Tom Cameron aboard.
</p>
<p>Tom, with the other men who had been exploring
and fishing all day, was ravenously hungry,
but he went around to the veranda of the chief
bungalow where his twin sister and Ruth stayed
to see how they were before even going to wash
and to see if he could bribe one of the cooks to
set out &#8220;a cold snack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom found Helen on the porch, alone. At a
glance, too, he saw that she was not in a pleasant
mood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s gone wrong?&#8221; demanded Tom. And
with a brother&#8217;s privilege of being plain-spoken,
he added: &#8220;You look cross. Go in search of
your temper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says I&#8217;ve lost it?&#8221; demanded Helen
sharply.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I Cagliostro&mdash;Merlin&mdash;wizard that I am,&#8221;
chuckled Tom. &#8220;I am still little Brighteyes, and
I can see just as far into a spruce plank as the
next one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am mad, if you want to know,&#8221; sniffed
Helen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Ruth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s whom I am mad at,&#8221; declared the girl,
nodding.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; said Tom soothingly. &#8220;We
could not really be mad at Ruth Fielding.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you feel that way yourself&mdash;the way
she acts with Chess Copley?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind punching &#8217;Lasses&#8217; head,&#8221; returned
Tom. &#8220;But that&#8217;s different.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so? What do you know about their
being out on the river together right now?
Humph!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have they gone?&#8221; asked her brother.
&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you with them? Are they alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This brought out the full particulars of the affair,
and Tom listened to the end of a rather excited
account of what had happened that afternoon&mdash;both
on the island where Helen and Ruth
had been &#8220;marooned&#8221; and here at the camp&mdash;together
with the suspicions and curiosity about the
island which had been dubbed the Kingdom of
Pipes. Nor did it lack interest in Tom&#8217;s ears in
spite of his sister&#8217;s rather excited way of telling it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But look here,&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you
go with Ruth and &#8217;Lasses?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! They didn&#8217;t want me,&#8221; sniffed
Helen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Helen, you know better. Ruth never
slighted you in the world. I know her better
than that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she makes too much of Chess Copley.
She is always praising him up to me. And I
don&#8217;t like it. I&#8217;ll treat him just as I want to&mdash;so
there!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom looked rather sober at this. He hesitated
a moment. He wanted to ask his pettish sister a
question, but evidently did not know how to go
about it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped now, I suppose. They will
be back after a while. Where were they going
besides to that crazy fellow&#8217;s island?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just there. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on and watch me eat. I&#8217;m starved.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks! I watched the pythons fed at the
zoo once,&#8221; said Helen with unwonted sharpness.
&#8220;I will sit here till the scene of savagery is over.
You can come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are in a fine mood, I see,&#8221; observed
Tom, and went off chuckling.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was not feeling very happy
himself over the thought that Ruth and Chess
Copley were out on the river together.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Looks mighty fishy,&#8221; muttered Tom Cameron.
&#8220;I could punch &#8217;Lasses&#8217; head, the way I feel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>These thoughts seemed to take Tom&#8217;s appetite
away. To his sister&#8217;s surprise, he returned
in a very few minutes to the front porch of the
bungalow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you that you had boa-constrictor
habits,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;Why, Tom Cameron! you
must have swallowed your supper whole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t swallow as much as I expected,&#8221; returned
the young man, smiling. But he grew serious
again. &#8220;How long was Chess going to stay
out in his boat?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose that I saw him go?&#8221; asked
Helen, with surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know that it is after eleven o&#8217;clock?&#8221;
said her brother. &#8220;If they went no further than
that crazy man&#8217;s island, what do you suppose
is keeping them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy&#8217;s sake! is that the time, Tommy-boy?
Why, the crazy man himself must be keeping
them! Do you suppose the King of the Pipes
has captured Ruth and Chess?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to be funny,&#8221; advised Tom. &#8220;It
may be no laughing matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I like that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that Chess would keep her out
so late if everything was all right. Sure they
were not going to Copley Island?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. The girls have gone away. There&#8217;s
no fun going on there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course the motor-boat may have
broken down. Such things happen,&#8221; said Tom
reflectively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you have got me stirred up,&#8221; cried
Helen. &#8220;I had no idea it was so late. And
Ruthie does not believe in late hours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She would not stay out on the river with me
half the night, that is sure,&#8221; grumbled Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tommy-boy!&#8221; exclaimed his sister, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe she cares so much for Chess. I
really don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that is not here nor there. What&#8217;s
to be done? Where&#8217;s Mr. Hammond&mdash;or
Willie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t got back from Chippewa Bay
with the <i>Gem</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This clumsy old <i>Tamarack</i> is too big for me
to handle alone. And the boys have all gone to
bed by this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The canoes aren&#8217;t too big for us to handle,&#8221;
Helen said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I insist on going, too, if you start out to
look for the <i>Lauriette</i>. And it will look better
too. If we are simply paddling about, there
being nothing the matter with Chess and Ruth,
they won&#8217;t be able to laugh at us. Come on!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
exclaimed Helen, picking up her sweater. &#8220;I
am a loyal sister, Tom Cameron.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right-o!&#8221; he agreed, more cheerfully. &#8220;I
suppose there really is nothing the matter. Yet,
whatever else Chess Copley is, he&#8217;s not the sort
of fellow to keep a girl out till midnight on the
river when there is nobody else along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! Do you think Ruth is a mere chit
of a flapper? You are old-fashioned, Tommy-boy.
The day of the chaperon is about over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know it isn&#8217;t over in our set, and never
will be,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;You girls have a lot of
freedom, I admit. But there are limits.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Baa!&#8221; was Helen&#8217;s utterly impudent remark.
</p>
<p>They ran down to the shore and got out one
of the canoes. Helen was familiar with the use of
the paddle and served her brother as a good second.
They drove the canoe out into the open
river, but only just for a look up its expanse.
</p>
<p>There was no motor-boat in sight or hearing&mdash;not
even the distant lights of one. The current
was so strong that the Cameron twins went back
among the islands where the water was smoother.
Besides, it was much more romantic, Helen said
wickedly, among the islands, and Chess and Ruth
were more likely to remain in the tortuous passages.
</p>
<p>The two laid a pretty direct course, however,
for the Kingdom of Pipes. As they spied it, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
drew nearer, Tom suddenly stopped paddling and
held up his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; demanded his sister, likewise
raising her paddle out of the water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; warned Tom.
</p>
<p>Faintly there came the noise of a motor-boat to
their straining ears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they are!&#8221; shrilled Helen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be still?&#8221; demanded her brother.
&#8220;That&#8217;s not Copley&#8217;s boat. It&#8217;s a deal bigger
craft. She&#8217;s on the other side of the island.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Helen leaned forward and caught at his sleeve.
&#8220;Look there!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;There is the
<i>Lauriette</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had been the first to see the outline of the
Copley launch moored close to the shore of the
island at its upper end.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone ashore,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;Where
can they be? If that other boat is approaching
this island&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tom! The pirates!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, fudge!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The smugglers, then. Chess said he believed
there were smugglers here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do they smuggle?&#8221; demanded Tom with
some scorn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. He did not seem very clear
about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same,&#8221; Tom observed, sinking his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
paddle again in the water, &#8220;there may be trouble
in the air.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble on the river, I guess you mean,&#8221;
giggled Helen.
</p>
<p>But she giggled because she was excited and
nervous. She was quite as alarmed as Tom was
over the possibility that Chess and Ruth had got
into some difficulty on the King of the Pipes&#8217;
island.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>TROUBLE ENOUGH</h3>
</div>

<p>Returning to Ruth Fielding in the cavern:
Although her heart beat rapidly and she really
was fearful, she showed little perturbation in her
countenance and manner after she had talked
with Charley Pond, if that was the real name of
the King of the Pipes.
</p>
<p>Just how mentally disturbed the old man was
it was difficult for the girl to judge. But she
feared that he had, after all his claims, absolutely
no influence with the Chinamen.
</p>
<p>She believed that the leader of the Orientals
was the heavy-set Chinaman who had struck
Chessleigh Copley down with the club. The
others&mdash;some smoking the little brass pipes, and
others not smoking&mdash;were probably men who
were endeavoring to get into the States without
the knowledge of the emigration authorities. Indeed,
they were already in New York. This island
was south of the American line. But from the
Kingdom of Pipes to any city where the Chinamen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
would be safe from apprehension was a
pretty big jump.
</p>
<p>As for the opium&mdash;the smoke of which Ruth
smelled now for the first time&mdash;she had no idea
how that commodity might be handled or disposed
of. She knew that it was valuable, even when
imported for medicinal purposes. There was a
heavy tariff on it, as well as restrictions upon the
trading in it.
</p>
<p>If those boxes&mdash;each as heavy as a man could
lift and which she and Chess had seen brought
ashore on this island&mdash;contained opium, there
might be many thousand of dollars&#8217; worth of the
drug, in its paste form, here now. Perhaps it
was hidden somewhere in this cave.
</p>
<p>Ruth had seated herself upon the end of one
of the low tables. She knew that all the furniture
in the cavern, including the rugs, must be of
Chinese manufacture. There could be no doubt
that the place was fitted up for the convenience
of the Orientals.
</p>
<p>She looked about, trying to penetrate the obscurity
of the place. Were there passages besides
the one by which she and Chess had been dragged
in? Were there other apartments in the cavern,
shut off by some of the hanging rugs which she
saw?
</p>
<p>Her principal thought, however, was of the
possibility of escape. And she wished heartily
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
that she and Copley could get out of the cave before
the arrival of the &#8220;others&#8221; of whom the King
of the Pipes had spoken. Whoever they might
be&mdash;or whether Horatio Bilby was one of them&mdash;Ruth
did not want to meet the smugglers and
Chinese runners.
</p>
<p>She feared very much for her safety, and for
that of her companion. The law-breakers would
know immediately that their safety was threatened.
They must know that if they allowed Ruth
and Chess to depart from the cave, their presence
here and what they were doing would be reported
to the police. And men like Bilby, who would
stoop to anything for money, were not likely to
give over such a profitable business as the smuggling
of opium without a fight.
</p>
<p>Just how much did Bilby and his companions
care for the law? It was a question that created
no little anxiety in Ruth&#8217;s mind. And she wondered,
too, what Chess thought about it.
</p>
<p>The young fellow lay upon the floor of the
cavern, silent and immovable. She was quite sure,
by the exceedingly knowing wink that he had
given her, that he was neither panic-stricken nor
seriously hurt. He was merely waiting to see
what would turn up.
</p>
<p>And what would happen when the new chance
did turn up? Already Chess was in opposition
to at least seven Chinamen, if he attempted anything.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
And if those the old man had spoken of,
likewise appeared, what could Copley do against
such numbers?
</p>
<p>There was nothing Ruth, herself, could do.
She sat quietly on the end of the low table and
looked sadly about the dimly lighted place. This
was certainly a situation from which her usually
ingenious mind could invent no means of escape.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the old man who called himself the
monarch of this island came from the corner
where he had been standing, watching Ruth, and
made his way swiftly to the entrance to the cave.
The big Chinaman got up and looked at him.
The King of the Pipes waved his hand and pointed
through the passage.
</p>
<p>It seemed to be sufficiently clear&mdash;that gesture&mdash;for
the Chinaman began to gabble to his
friends. They scrambled to their feet&mdash;all but
two who had fallen into a sluggish state after their
indulgence in the use of the drug. They looked
toward the cavern entrance. The King of the
Pipes disappeared through the passage.
</p>
<p>Ruth stole a stealthy glance at Chess. She saw
that he had moved. He was lying with his right
hand covered by his body. There seemed an alertness
about him&mdash;in posture and in gleaming, half-closed
eyes&mdash;that startled Ruth. What had the
young fellow in his mind to do. For what was
he waiting?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>In a minute she heard the ring of quick steps
upon the rock-floor of the tunnel.
</p>
<p>Ruth shrank away from the table and stood
at her companion&#8217;s head. What would the newcomers&mdash;Bilby,
perhaps&mdash;do to Copley and to
her?
</p>
<p>And it was Bilby! The little, red-faced, greenish-eyed
man, projected himself into the cavern
as though he had been shot out of a gun.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter here? What&#8217;s going on,
I want to know? That crazy-head is trying to tell
me something&mdash;Ye gods! A girl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He saw Ruth vaguely. Then he glanced down
at the prostrate Copley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knocked him out?&#8221; demanded Bilby.
</p>
<p>The burly Chinaman was the one he addressed,
who answered in a form of English:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Allee same me. I get um, Mist&#8217; Blibly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For mercy&#8217;s sake!&#8221; whined Bilby, wringing
his fat hands. &#8220;These people aren&#8217;t police. They
are some of the summer visitors. Now we <i>are</i>
in a mess!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Allee same look-see,&#8221; growled the Chinaman.
He kicked Chessleigh, and not gently. &#8220;Number
one sneakee&mdash;him! She&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He nodded violently toward Ruth, thus drawing
Bilby&#8217;s attention to the girl. Bilby strained
his fat neck forward to see the girl more closely.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
There were other sounds coming from the passage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s doing, Mr Bilby?&#8221; asked a gruff voice.
</p>
<p>The fat little man was panting. He pointed
waveringly at Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a pretty mess,&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;What
between these Chinks and that crazy old duffer,
they have got me in a nice mess. I know this girl.
She belongs to that moving picture outfit. Now
what are we going to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Knock her in the head,&#8221; was the advice of
the growling voice.
</p>
<p>The advice probably was not intended to be
followed. It was said perhaps to scare Ruth.
But it excited somebody else besides the girl of
the Red Mill.
</p>
<p>Before Bilby could reply or anybody else
could speak, Copley came to his feet with all the
suddenness of a jumping-jack. Bilby squealed and
started back, falling against the gruff man who
had followed him into the cave and who was
evidently the boatman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; ejaculated this man.
</p>
<p>But that was all he said. The Chinamen
squealed in unison, and that was all from them.
Bilby himself faintly groaned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put your hands up&mdash;all of you!&#8221; commanded
Copley, and one of the most amazing things about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
the whole wild extravaganza was that the young
fellow&#8217;s voice was perfectly unshaken.
</p>
<p>Lads that have been in the army are apt to consider
circumstances like these as meat and drink
to them. Chessleigh had not served Uncle Sam
in vain. He was as cool as the proverbial cucumber!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put your hands up&mdash;all of you! There are ten
shots in this magazine and every one of them will
get its man. Quick! Up with &#8217;em!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In all probability only one of the Chinamen
understood this strictly American form of expression.
But when the burly Chinaman elevated
his yellow hands, his fellow countrymen did the
same.
</p>
<p>As for Bilby and the boatman, they reached
toward the roof of the cavern hastily. There
was no hesitation on their part. Although Copley
was alone, his unwavering attitude and the
threat of the automatic pistol, played hob with
such shreds of courage as the malefactors possessed.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>A LETTER COMES</h3>
</div>

<p>Nobody had come through the passage into
the cave save Bilby and the boatman. Chess
stood where he could keep half an eye, at least,
upon the opening, and although the passage was
filled with shadow he was quite sure there was
nobody lurking there who was friendly to the law-breakers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just step around behind those two men and
see if they are armed, Miss Ruth, will you?&#8221; went
on Copley. &#8220;Take &#8217;em from behind. Don&#8217;t get
in line with my pistol. For if I begin to shoot,
somebody is bound to get hit. Keep your hands
up, you fellows!&#8221; and he gestured toward the
Chinamen.
</p>
<p>Even the two of their number who had been
half-overcome with the fumes of opium had come
to attention when Chess produced his pistol. The
Chinamen huddled together at one side. The
boatman and Bilby were opposite the doorway of
the tunnel. Ruth promptly obeyed Chess and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
went around behind the last-named two of the
enemy.
</p>
<p>Ruth hesitated a moment in the dusk there at
the opening of the passage. She hated to touch
either Bilby or the other man. But probably both
of them were armed, and for the sake of safety
their weapons must be taken from them.
</p>
<p>While she hesitated she heard a faint rustle in
the passage. Then came the softest possible
whisper:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ss-st!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth jumped and glanced over her shoulder.
Was it friend or enemy who evidently tried to
attract her attention by this sibilant sound?
</p>
<p>A figure moved in the gloom. Before she could
cry any warning to Copley an arm was put firmly
about her and Ruth was almost lifted to one side.
She saw the gleam of a weapon in the other hand
of her neighbor, and the point of this weapon
was dug suddenly into the broad back of the
gruff boatman who was Bilby&#8217;s companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get nervous, &#8217;Lasses,&#8221; came in Tom
Cameron&#8217;s voice. &#8220;We&#8217;re all friends here. Ah!
A nice automatic pistol from our friend, Mr.
Bilby. Just so. Here, Nell!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But it was Ruth&#8217;s hand that took the captured
weapon, although Helen stood at her side squeezing
her other hand and whispering:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness, Ruthie, what a perfectly glorious
experience! Are those the real smugglers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; replied her friend.
Then she accepted the revolver extracted from
the hip pocket of the boatman by Tom Cameron.
&#8220;Where is the King of the Pipes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking the air. We heard the talk below
here through the hollow tree. Do you know,&#8221;
whispered Helen, &#8220;that old beech is a regular
chimney. And we saw the boat come here.
Then we grabbed the King of the Pipes outside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom did not hurt him, I hope?&#8221; murmured
Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. In fact, the queer old fellow
said he was willing to abdicate in Tom&#8217;s
favor, and now, I suppose, Tommy-boy is King
of the Pipes,&#8221; and Helen, the irrepressible,
grinned.
</p>
<p>The two ex-army men, however, took the matter
quite seriously. Tom disarmed the Chinamen
as well as the white men. And to search and
disarm a squirming Oriental, they found not easy
work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I disarmed enough Fritzies in Europe to
learn my job pretty well. How&#8217;s the weather,
Sergeant?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right here, Captain Cameron,&#8221; said Copley
seriously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll back out with this bunch of junk.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
Here&#8217;s a pair of brass knuckles in the bunch. I&#8217;ll
use &#8217;em on any of these fellows who try to run.
We&#8217;ll keep &#8217;em hived up here till the police come.
One fellow can hold &#8217;em. Unless they try to
climb up that hollow beech tree.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No fear,&#8221; said Copley. &#8220;Get the girls out
first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom had already loaded both Ruth and Helen
down with the loot from the malefactors&#8217; pockets.
He motioned to the girls to leave the
cavern.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on! Hold on!&#8221; Bilby cried. &#8220;I beg of
you, don&#8217;t leave me with these men. I only happen
to be here by chance&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A bad chance for you, then,&#8221; said Chess Copley.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t listen to him, Captain Cameron.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t listen to him,&#8221; said Ruth severely.
&#8220;I know he is worse than the others. Why,
Tom! he is the man who has made us all that
trouble about Wonota and my picture.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; agreed Tom. &#8220;I know the snake.
Go ahead, girls. Chess and I will follow you.
And one of us will be right in this passage all the
time,&#8221; he added, addressing the two white men.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t make any mistake. We&#8217;ll shoot if you
try to come out until you are told to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls were already feeling their way
through the darkness of the tunnel. At the turn
Ruth kicked something, and, stooping, secured
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
Chess&#8217; electric torch. She pressed the switch and
the illumination allowed the two young men to
overtake them with more certainty, Chess backing
out with his pistol trained on the opening into
the cavern.
</p>
<p>When once the four friends were around the
turn and out of hearing of the prisoners, Tom
Cameron began to chuckle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is no laughing matter!&#8221; exclaimed his
sister. &#8220;I am so excited I don&#8217;t know what to
do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep right on,&#8221; said Ruth. &#8220;I want to get
home just as soon as I can. I don&#8217;t believe I
shall care hereafter to leave the island until we
are through with the picture and can go back to
the Red Mill. What are you laughing about,
Tom Cameron?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how &#8217;Lasses is fixed,&#8221; said the
amused Tom. &#8220;But my pistol isn&#8217;t loaded. It
is my old service automatic and needs repairing,
anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fret, Cameron. Mine is loaded all
right,&#8221; said Chess grimly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you stay and guard the cave,&#8221; said
Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet you! You couldn&#8217;t get me away from
here until you have sent for the sheriff and he
comes for the gang. I believe we have done a
good night&#8217;s work.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you were wonderful!&#8221; Helen burst out.
&#8220;And Ruth says they knocked you down and hurt
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall get over that all right,&#8221; returned Chess
quietly.
</p>
<p>But when they were out of the passage and
on the open shore Helen insisted upon fussing
around Chessleigh, bathing the lump on his head,
and otherwise &#8220;mothering&#8221; him in a way that
secretly delighted Ruth. Tom looked at his sister
in some amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about that?&#8221; he whispered
to Ruth. &#8220;She was as sore at him as she could
be an hour ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know your own sister very well,
Tom,&#8221; retorted Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; ejaculated Tom Cameron. &#8220;Perhaps
we fellows don&#8217;t understand any girl very
well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Ruth was not to be led into any discussion
of that topic then. It was agreed that she and
Helen and Tom should hurry back to the motion
picture camp at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The King of the Pipes won&#8217;t bite you,&#8221; Tom
said to Chess. &#8220;Only don&#8217;t let him go back into
the cave. Those fellows might do him some
harm. And the sheriff will want him for a witness
against the gang. He is not so crazy as he
makes out to be.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>The night&#8217;s adventures were by no means completed,
for Ruth and Helen could not go to bed
after they reached the bungalow until they knew
how it all turned out. Mr. Hammond had returned
before them, and Willie and Tom started
at once for Chippewa Bay in the <i>Gem</i>.
</p>
<p>The capture of Bilby in connection with the
smugglers and Chinese runners delighted the motion
picture producer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will settle the controversy, I believe,&#8221;
Mr. Hammond said to the two girls. &#8220;Bilby&#8217;s
attempt to annoy us must fall through now. We
will get Totantora and Wonota back from Canada
and finish the picture properly. But, believe
me! I have had all the experience I want
with freak stars. The expense and trouble I have
been put to regarding Wonota has taught me a
lesson. I&#8217;d sell my contract with Wonota to-morrow&mdash;or
after the picture is done&mdash;for a
song.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth looked at him steadily for a moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that, Mr. Hammond?&#8221; she
asked quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Helen laughed. &#8220;I guess Ruth is thinking of
singing that song. Ruth believes in Wonota.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could carry the tune,&#8221; her chum said,
more lightly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll talk of that later, Mr.
Hammond.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I would give you first chance, Miss
Ruth,&#8221; said the producer. &#8220;By the way,&#8221; and he
turned to his desk. &#8220;I brought mail from the
town. Here are several letters for you, Miss
Ruth, and one for Miss Cameron.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls began to open their letters as soon as
they reached their room. But it was Helen&#8217;s
single epistle that created the most excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from Carrie Perrin,&#8221; she said to Ruth.
Then, in a moment, she uttered a cry that drew
Ruth&#8217;s full attention. &#8220;Listen to this! What do
you know about this, Ruth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, my dear?&#8221; asked her chum, in her
usual composed manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think of that!&#8221; cried Helen, in tears.
&#8220;And I have treated him so hatefully. He&#8217;ll
never forgive me in this world, I suppose. It is
about Chess,&#8221; she sobbed, and handed her chum
the letter.

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE HEART&#8217;S DESIRE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;And what do you think of this, Nell? I&#8217;ve
wormed out of Bill Kenmore the truth about that
mean joke the boys played on us last spring when
we were all at Jennie Stone&#8217;s. Excuse! I suppose
I should say Madame Marchand&#8217;s. To
think of Heavy Stone being an old married
woman now!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Bill Kenmore always did have a crazy
streak&mdash;and he wasn&#8217;t shell-shocked in France,
either. You remember the time you went away
down town in answer to a telegram, thinking it
was somebody who needed you very much, and
you walked into that place and found the boys
all dressed up and ready to give you the &#8216;ha, ha!&#8217;?
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it got you awfully mad&mdash;and I don&#8217;t
blame you. Chess was there, I know. But he
didn&#8217;t even know what the row was all about.
Bill engineered the whole thing, and he thinks
still that it was an awfully good joke. His ideas
of humor must have originated in the Stone Age.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I made him tell me all about it, he thinking
I would be amused. Then I turned him right
out of our parlor and told him not to call again.
I hear that he thinks I am a regular cat!
</p>
<p>&#8220;But who wouldn&#8217;t be cattish with a fellow who
has no more sense? Anyhow, we know the truth
now. Perhaps Chess Copley is not very sharp,
but I couldn&#8217;t think of his doing anything really
mean. So now you know. If Chess is up there
at the Thousand Islands you can tell him from
me, at least, that &#8216;all is forgiven.&#8217; Sounds like a
newspaper personal, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Ruth stopped reading there, and looked brightly
at her chum.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of that?&#8221; asked the latter,
wiping her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my dear, I shouldn&#8217;t cry about it,&#8221; said
Ruth. &#8220;I think it is an occasion to be joyful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Chess&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is of a forgiving nature, I think,&#8221; Ruth said.
&#8220;At any rate, I would not let the matter stand
between me and a nice boy friend any longer. I
could never suspect Chess of doing an unkind
thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have wronged him!&#8221; cried Helen, who
was, after all, tender-hearted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said her friend, &#8220;I believe you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
can make it up to him very nicely, if you want to,
Helen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The <i>Gem</i> returned to the island just at daybreak.
The girls ran down to the dock to meet
the returned young men and Willie. Chess
Copley had come to get his own motor-boat, and
the report they made of the end of the smuggling
affair was very satisfactory.
</p>
<p>The sheriff and his posse in a big motor-boat
had gone to the Kingdom of Pipes and relieved
Chess of his duty as guardian of the cave. The
Chinamen, who were hiding there until they could
be shipped into the States dressed in feminine
garments, were all handcuffed, together with the
owner of the launch and Horatio Bilby, and loaded
into the sheriff&#8217;s launch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you should have heard Bilby squeal,&#8221;
said Tom. &#8220;There is one bad egg who is likely
to pay a considerable penalty for his crimes.
He&#8217;ll not get out of the mess very easy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What of the King of the Pipes?&#8221; asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old Charley-Horse Pond,&#8221; Willie, the
boatman, said, &#8220;will be detained as a witness.
Already he has got a new name for himself. He
isn&#8217;t &#8216;King of the Pipes&#8217; any longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Ruth inquired, for she
was interested in the queer old man and his fate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me that he was Major André,&#8221;
chuckled Willie. &#8220;He is a Number One spy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
The sheriff knows him well and knows there isn&#8217;t
a mite of harm in him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Later it came out that the old man had been living
on the island for some time, having found
the cave there. The smugglers of opium and the
Chinese found him there and made use of him.
But when the court proceedings came on, Pond
was merely used by the prosecution as a witness.
His harmlessness was too apparent for the court
to doubt him.
</p>
<p>That particular day had to be a day of rest for
Ruth and her friends, for they had had no sleep
the night before. But while they slept Mr. Hammond&#8217;s
representative went in search of Totantora
and Wonota and the two Osage Indians
were brought back to the moving picture camp
before night.
</p>
<p>The work of making the last scenes of &#8220;The
Long Lane&#8217;s Turning&#8221; was taken up at once, and
until the last scene was taken Ruth and her associates
were very busy indeed. The Cameron
twins spent most of the ensuing time with the
Copleys and the other summer visitors. And it
was noticeable that Helen was attended by Chess
Copley almost everywhere she went.
</p>
<p>Tom saw this with some wonder; but he found
very little opportunity to talk to Ruth about it.
And when he tried to question Helen regarding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
her change toward Chess, she quite ignored the
subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me,&#8221; Tom said to himself, &#8220;as
though I was shut out in the cold. I wish I
hadn&#8217;t come up here. I might as well be slaving
in that old office. Gee, I&#8217;m an unlucky dog!&#8221;
</p>
<p>For Tom, no more than Helen, could not see
that Ruth&#8217;s attitude toward the matter of strenuous
occupation for a wealthy young man was
a fair one. Tom certainly had none of Uncle
Jabez Potter&#8217;s blood in his veins.
</p>
<p>The big scene at the end of the picture&mdash;the
throne room of the French king&mdash;was as carefully
made as the other parts of the picture had been.
And because of Ruth&#8217;s coaching Wonota did her
part so well that Mr. Hooley was enthusiastic&mdash;and
to raise enthusiasm in the bosom of a case-hardened
director is no small matter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Boss is rather sore on the whole business,&#8221;
Hooley said to Ruth. &#8220;It has been an expensive
picture, I admit. We have gone away
over the studio estimate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is not my fault, nor your fault, nor
the Indian girl&#8217;s fault. Mr. Hammond is not to
be blamed either, I suppose, for feeling worried.
The motion picture business is getting to that
stage now where lavish expenditure must be curtailed.
I fancy Mr. Hammond will make only
five-reel program pictures for some time. And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
where will your big feature pictures come in, Miss
Fielding?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The program pictures are sure-fire, I suppose,&#8221;
the girl admitted. &#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t take much of
a story to make those. Nor does it give the stars
as good a chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, lean years may be coming. We shall
all have to draw in our horns. Remember me,
Miss Fielding, if you decide to produce with some
other firm. I like to work with you, and I have
a more or less elastic contract with the Alectrion
Corporation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth actually did have an idea for the future.
It was in embryo as yet. But, as will be seen in
the next volume of this series, entitled, &#8220;Ruth
Fielding Treasure Hunting; Or, A Moving Picture
that Became Real,&#8221; it led the girl of the Red
Mill into new fields and drew her and her friends
into new adventures.
</p>
<p>The last scene being completed, Ruth and
Helen packed their trunks. But Helen was to
ship hers to the Copley&#8217;s island up the river,
where she would stay for a week or so before returning
to Cheslow. Ruth was going back to the
Red Mill, and after that she was not sure of her
movements.
</p>
<p>Tom would accompany her home. She was
glad of this, for she knew that, once at home,
he must of necessity take up his work again with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
his father. Tom Cameron, however, confessed
that he &#8220;hated&#8221; the dry goods business.
</p>
<p>Chess Copley showed his appreciation of
Ruth&#8217;s kindness and friendship in a very pretty
way indeed. He came to her secretly with a
jeweler&#8217;s box in his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Ruth, you have been just like a
sister to me since you have been up here. I think
as much of you as I do of Sara and Jean&mdash;I declare
I do! And I know Helen&mdash;or&mdash;or anybody,
won&#8217;t mind if you wear this little trinket. When
you wear it remember you&#8217;ve got a good friend
whose initials are engraved on the inside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth accepted the present frankly, for she liked
Chess. But she did not know how beautiful the
bracelet was until after Copley had disappeared
in his <i>Lauriette</i>. It was more costly than Ruth
thought a present from that source should be.
</p>
<p>So, rather doubtful, she said nothing to Tom
Cameron about the bracelet, although she wore
it. She knew that she would have refused such
a present from Tom himself. But, then&mdash;there
was a difference!
</p>
<p>She did not intend to be rushed into any agreement
with Tom Cameron that would at all interfere
with her freedom. She still had her career
in mind.
</p>
<p>They got back to Cheslow early in July. And
how glad Aunt Alvirah was to see her pretty. As
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
for Uncle Jabez, his interest was in the commercial
end of the picture Ruth had made.
</p>
<p>Was it going to make money when it was
distributed? How much money had Ruth already
drawn in advance royalties? And a multitude
of other questions of that character came
from the old miller&#8217;s lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And when do you begin on another of them
pictures, Niece Ruth?&#8221; he added. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t
going to stop now, when there is so much to
be made in &#8217;em?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know exactly what I shall do next,&#8221;
she told him, shaking her head. &#8220;But I think I
shall try to make my next picture under different
circumstances. But as I don&#8217;t really know, how
can I tell you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, my pretty,&#8221; put in Aunt Alvirah,
&#8220;you are here with us now, and that means a lot.
You certainly deserve a rest,&#8221; and the old woman
placed an affectionate hand on Ruth&#8217;s shoulder.
</p>
<p>At this the girl of the Red Mill smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I do,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;after all those
strenuous happenings on the St. Lawrence.&#8221;
